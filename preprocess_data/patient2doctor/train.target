Hello, I understand your concern. I just have a few more questions. Does your cough has phlegm? Any other symptoms like difficulty breathing? Any other medical condition such as asthma, hypertension? Are you a smoker? Alcoholic beverage drinker? 
Hi, I would recommend you take n-acetylcysteine 200 mg powder dissolved in water three times a day. You may also nebulize using PNSS (saline nebulizer) three times a day. This will help the phlegm to come out. I would also recommend you take vitamin C 500 mg and zinc to boost your immune system. If symptoms persist, worsen or new onset of symptoms has been noted, further consult is advised.  
Hello, I can understand your concern. In my opinion, you should get done a chest x-ray and CBC (complete blood count). If both these are normal then no need to worry much. I hope this helps. 
Hi, yes, upload in this query only. I will see and revert to you. 
Hi, I can understand your concern. I have gone through the report you have attached. (attachment removed to protect patient identity). Your total count is on the higher side of normal along with low hemoglobin. So start Azithromycin 500 mg 1-0-0, Tablet Dolo 650 1-0-1. Once your fever and cough subside, start an Iron tablet for low hemoglobin. I hope this helps. 
Hi, Yes, you can take iron tablet from today onwards. And no need for Azithromycin now as you have already taken it. Drink plenty of fluids orally and keep yourself hydrated. Do warm water gargles and steam inhalation four to five times a day.  
Hello. Anxiety can manifest itself in physical or psychological symptoms or both. The irritation sensation you are experiencing is a part of your anxiety. Also please do not believe the hype about covid. It has a low mortality rate, of 2-3 percent, that too mortality is very high in people above 60-70 years with other co-morbidities. You do not have any such disorders and you have not even been in contact with anyone, so do not worry. Please continue to take your medicines for anxiety if you are taking them, if not, please consider visiting a psychiatrist and get started on some low dose SSRI type of medicines. Also, if needed a low dose Benzodiazepines can be added temporarily. Also, please do some deep breathing exercises, or progressive muscle relaxation. You can also take some honey with water to reduce the itching in the throat and also try doing some gargles with lukewarm salt water.  
Hello, please answer the following: Any travel history in the last one month? Any use of airports? Any fever, have you checked the temperature? Any cough? Any mucus or phlegm? How is your sleep? Is there any malaise or body aches or weakness? 
Hi, most probably with the history it does not appear like a severe problem or Coronavirus infection. Is sore throat severe and does the pain last the whole day? Do you smoke or drink? Can you try taking Sudafed, Tylenol, and Zyrtec and try getting sleep for a few days? I am sure that will make you feel better. Avoid exposure to smoke dust and cold winds. Keep the AC to a minimum or use ceiling fan instead. Drink plenty of water and warm fluids. Avoid eating out, partying. Avoid unnecessary travel. You need not quarantine yourself in the strictest manner but some amount of restrictions in interacting and meeting with the community is advised. Lastly, where are you currently? Your place of residence and country? Is it a Corona endemic country? Did you talk to or interact with any known or suspected flu patient? Can you please take a picture of the back of the throat with open mouth showing details of the tonsils and pharyngeal wall and send it to me? 
Hi, you have got it right. Follow all the precautions. You will be alright soon. Try getting a good sleep tonight. I heard about the cases in SF. My brother was supposed to fly there from India for work but his meeting got canceled in the wake of the virus. Yes, your camera has not done a decent job this time around. It has not focussed on our area of interest. (attachment removed to protect patient identity). But yours has picked up the two big bumps in the back of the throat (enlarged tonsils). The tonsils could be enlarged due to the current infection and sore throat problem you are having. Once the problem is resolved they should get back to their normal size, which I guess, in you, must be slightly big. The pharyngeal wall between the tonsils could be having some granular bumps which are quite common during an infection. Now you do not worry, for most such infections are due to viruses (not Corona). They usually get better with time and supportive treatment. Traditional Indian forms of medicine advise honey and hot water. Tea makes a good addition I guess. Sudafed and Zyrtec appropriate for your weight will help additionally. Tylenol every time you got pain will help you tide over this period wonderfully. Now watch for some warning symptoms fever, increased pain, thick mucus, thick postnasal drip, severe malaise, swelling in the neck, etc. In such cases promptly revert to me. You may need a Z pack then. 
Hello, always Protonix is better than Zantac. Try using Protonix (Pantoprazole). Do not lie down immediately after consuming meals. Do not drink a lot of water after a meal. Avoid spicy and oily foods. 
Hi, you need to take Pantoprazole or any other proton pump inhibitor. Avoid heavy meals. The issue appears like a heartburn problem due to acidity only. It does not appear sinister. 
Hi, do not worry about it. Drink plenty of water but not immediately after a meal. Eat well cooked meats. 
Hi, do not worry so much. You will be absolutely alright. Give it some time. If you are not getting better we can do laryngoscopy and check if there is anything wrong with the larynx. Do you eat healthy food and do exercises? 
I guess you are in the right track. With regards to food diet and exercise. Restart doing your exercise. Keep yourself active. Try having more than three meals a day but keep the quantity of each meal less than the usual. That way you eat more frequently but without putting weight or adding unnecessary calories. 
 
Hello and welcome to Ask A Doctor service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. First few cases were suspected to have spread from food. However human to human spread is mainly from air droplets. I would suggest you to refrain from swimming for sometime. Although the virus will get killed in swimming pool if it doesnot find host for more than few minutes. Other precautions include to avoid social gatherings, wash hands frequently with soap and water, cover face with mask, stay home during sickness, avoid travel. Hope it helps. Let me know if I can assist you further. Dr Vaishalee  
Depends on severity. COVID-19 pandemic at this time, so a doctor on video may consult by video instead of requiring an in-person visit. Flu-like symptoms can be from a strep throat infection, a cold or influenza, or from some other cause like COVID-19. Usually, a person calls the doctor if the symptoms are bothersome, serious, recurrent, or persistent. COVID-19 testing depends on local availability.  
Real vs. textbook. Real-life criteria is different because we don't have enough tests, supplies, or medical staff around the world at this time (March 2020). Textbook criteria are suspected COVID in hospitalized persons or in those with underlying medical conditions; or persons who got symptoms less than 14 days after (1) contact with a suspect or confirmed COVID patient or (2) travel through high-risk COVID area.  
Without any details it's impossible to say.  
Without any details it's impossible to say.  
COVID-19 symptoms. Nausea, vomiting, and/or diarrhea occur fairly frequently early in the infection, but are rarely if ever the only symptoms. If cough and fever don't develop within a day or two after vomiting or diarrhea, probably it isn't COVID-19.  
Break. At 39 your risk for severe infections is very low. A strategy that I recommend is taking in information daily, but get away from it. Practice prudent precautions. In my off times away from ER (still practicing front line ER) I focus my mind on my cooking, planning my garden, engage with my friends and loved ones and read.  
CoV229e is one of several coronaviruses that cause common colds. Biologically related to SARS-CoV-2 (the cause of COVID-19), but different viruses.  
Seek care right away if difficulty breathing, other severe symptoms. Seek testing if sick, PLUS known Covid-19 contact, or travel to high risk country, or been in facility treating people with Covid-19, or severe pneumonia of unknown cause. Call 0800 029 999 for test. If sick or possibly exposed (not both), stay home. Seek consultation if sick. If known exposure & not sick, self-isolate 14 days.  
your local doctor, local health department, we have no idea here what your set up is where you live.  
COVID infections will likely pick up over the next few weeks in US. Avoiding travel and following hand washing recommendations are probably the most important prophylactic measures.  
Symptoms of COVID-19 are usually the same as a cold or the flu, with diarrhea being uncommon. The COVID-19 infection is worldwide. The goal is to keep people separated so that the clinics and hospitals are not overwhelmed. Patients with medical symptoms should see their primary care doctor on VIDEO or by PHONE, and get instructed to go to a clinic or ER only if not treatable by video or phone.  
The symptom pattern is not specific to one agent. It suggests a cold and ear infection. Kids have been among those least affected by Covid-19 . Only proper screening and testing could confirm or exclude this or any other agent. Parainfluenza, rhinovirus, or RSV would be more likely.  
Unlikely Not at this point. Treat what you have currently symptomatically. Stock up now whilst not yet on lockdown. I don't feel that you qualify for a Covid test right now. Keep posting your questions.  
Data From Data from China there has been association between worse infection and diarrhea. The seems to be a worse inflammatory response associated with people who have diarrhea.  
No To date the process has been a respiratory virus. No gut issues (diarrhea,etc.) are reported so far as part of the symptom pattern.  
Sort of If you are having sex with someone who has Covid-19 you are quite at risk of getting it. High likelihood if kissing and having intercourse but it may not be transmitted through intercourse but the closeness in an intimate situation like that with someone who is infected gives a high likelihood of transmission.  
Yes This virus clings to everything especially hairs. Either wash your beard a few times a day and spray with alcohol or shave off.  
COVID-19 and Asthma Great question. Yes asthma is a chronic lung disease which carries some increased risk with COVID-19. Good asthma control along with good handwashwng, social distancing avoiding unnecessary travel along with your young age should keep your risk of complications low. Smoking, hypertension, diabetes, obesity or compromised immune system are also risk factors to be considered.  
Maybe Being over 50 with a medical condition like intermittent asthma makes you at higher risk for any respiratory illness including COVID19. It appears to be less an issue for children and youth.  
Not quite that way People with chronic lung problems do worse in a lung disease outbreak. For one specific person... well, there's no way to guess. "People" in general do worse if they have UNcontrolled lung disease. That means it's likely that asthmatics using inhaled steroids to give them good disease control will be BETTER OFF than asthmatics who use steroids but still cannot get good control. Be in good control.  
No Diarrhea does not rule out COVID. If you have traveled to endemic areas or met with people that traveled there, you should test if possible.  
Sort of If you are having sex with someone who has Covid-19 you are quite at risk of getting it. High likelihood if kissing and having intercourse but it may not be transmitted through intercourse but the closeness in an intimate situation like that with someone who is infected gives a high likelihood of transmission.  
COVID-19 mortality Don't confuse actual mortality rate with REPORTED rate. The actual rate probably will remain stable (and likely lower in the US than some other countries, because of sophisticated intensive medical care). But as testing expands and more people with mild symptoms (or no symptoms) are diagnosed, reported mortality will decline; likely happening now, but it may take weeks for data to be known.  
Hard to say The questions you pose are more appropriate to ask your local physicians and health plans. As a USA based site we have no access to or information about the changing local recommendations for world travel around the globe nor would we know what your plan covers. Find a local health contact & contact your health plan for guidance.  
Standard precautions COVID-19 is now official name for the illness caused by the newly discovered coronavirus (COronaVirus Infectious Disease - 2019). So far it is extremely rare in the US (2/12/20). Until and unless COVID-19 becomes common no special precautions are necessary. In any dormitory or group living situation people with respiratory symptoms (colds, flu, etc.) should cover their coughs and wash hands frequently.  
Vitamin C While getting enough vitamin C in your diet is highly recommended, it has no special ability to prevent coronavirus or flu virus. Best preventative measures for these are frequent handwashing and avoiding people with sneezing/coughing/cold symptoms and fevers.  
Yes It helps to keep the body in good shape and good nutrition.  
Hello, * The pneumonia shot per se is not responsible for high WBC count, but as you are telling there are soreness and bad feeling at the injection site over arm, there are all possibilities that you have cellulitis or possible abscess formation at the injection site; which will recruit neutrophils at the site and cause secondary rise in WBC count. * Primary relief with ice application and secondary management with systemic antibiotics and anti-inflammatory medicines with your doc.

Hello,To be honest, there is a chance of cross infection from one person to another. However, this depends on so many factors and most of the infections, especially bacterial pneumonia, do not transmit easily.

Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic.I can understand your concern. Pneumonia is less likely to cause nose bleeding. Recurrent nose bleeding with coughing are commonly seen with sinusitis. So better to consult ENT doctor and get done clinical examination and CT scan of paranasal sinuses (PNS). Also get done chest x ray for pneumonia.

You may also need endoscopic evaluation of sinuses if CT PNS is suggestive of infection or erosion.Don't worry, you will be alright with all these. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.

Low blood pressure can be a serious and life-threatening problem. Is her blood pressure normally a lot higher than this? If so, then I would suggest urgent evaluation by a physician. Infections can lead to a response called sepsis, and part of this may include a drop in blood pressure, which can be dangerous to her organs. Ensuring adequate hydration is important, as dehydration can cause low blood pressure as well. If she is acting confused, fatigued, or more tired than usual then I would suggest urgent medical evaluation. I hope she feels better.  
Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic.I can understand your concern. In my opinion, you should consult pediatric pulmonologist and get done bronchoscopy and BAL (bronchoalveolar lavage) analysis.BAL culture and sensitivity report will isolate the causative organism and guide about effective antibiotic treatment.

Thanks for your concern. The dry cough basically has a few causes....First is Post nasal drip, second Gastroesophageal reflux'heart burn', third Cough variant aasthma, forth Heart failure and finally Interstitial lung disease. Based on the information if you don't have a heart burn or reflux of food or sour brash into your mouth, you are having a cough variant asthma, make sure you do not have difficulty breathing. There is something called cardiac asthma, but it's not much of a likelihood given your young age.I advice you that you give up on smoking as it causes a multitude of problems and may well be related to the cough you've been having now called as 'smokers cough'.It's time that you stop smoking, avoid animal dancers, mites, pollens and any thing that would exacerbate the illness, make sure you don't have a heart burn, and if still the cough persists , meet a pulmo neologism and get a Pulmonary function test with methacholine challenge

Hello Gigi !Coughing up blood with sputum (henoptysis) is a red flag sign .. meaning to say it definitely needs Medical attention . Considering you have had TB in the past there are many possibilities for your present episodes of hemoptysis. It could me a bacterial infection or relapse of TB or post TB bronchiectasis (abnormal permanent dilation of your airways at few places which happens when they get damaged due to your past TB). Take a course of antibiotic as prescribed by your physician ,Consult with your physician and discuss about taking drugs like tranexemic acid which reduce the bleeding tendency , cough suppressants . while sleeping, Lie on the side which was previously affected by TB and be on complete bed rest . Once your hemoptysis gets controlled go for sputum examination to check for TB bacilli , chest x ray and if needed HRCT thorax (to pick up bronchiectasis which can sometimes be not evident on x ray). Since u mentioned severe back pain , vascular abnormalities concerning the descending aorta (the major blood vessel carrying blood from the heart)needs to be also considered Treatment is to be decided based on the cause for your hemoptysis.Do review with your physician and get the necessary investigations done.

Hello welcome to HCM. I have gone through your history. You have been adequately treated for your pneumonia and I suppose you don't have any symptoms of pneumonia like cough, fast breathing, fever, breathlessness. Since you have received intravenous plus 5 days of oral antibiotics, now you can resume about your exercise regime. As you say you had a non damaging heart attack, means that your heart pumping function is well preserved. So you must not have any issues with exercise. With every lung infection the lung capacity decreases by some percentage proportional to he severity of the infection. Hence along with your routine exercises you must also undergo breathing exercises with incentive spirometry, inhaling deeply through one nose holding your breath and exhaling fully from the other nose, meditation and yoga. This will help you to regain some of the lost lung capacity. You should also get vaccinated with influenza and pneumonia vaccines that include common strains which cause pneumonia Remember they don't protect you against all pneumonias but offer protection against common pneumonias.Regarding Naproxen too much of it may cause damage to your kidneys so I advice you decrease its usage and use it only when required rather than a daily basis.Wishing you good health. Regards

Respected user, hi I evaluated your query thoroughly.* What is meant by '' there is no change'' in x-ray ? mean to convey that the pneumonia is as it is in x-ray as before treatment ? then in that case it is non-responsive treatment.* In addition to that your symptoms also show that you are not alright to much extent .* Chest pain & cramps are in relation with underlying pneumonia, you are telling that treatment is over but no it is not finished.@ Recommend to consult with all details of scanned reports , treatment taken till now , so that we can study the case in detail & make guidelines for further perfect recovery .Hope this helps you.Welcome for any further assistance.Thanks for using Healthcaremagic.com & reviewing my answer thoroughly.Wishing you fine recovery from the same.Regards dear take care.  
Hey,Minimal linear atelectasis doesn't mean pneumonia of lung, but still if you are diagnosed as pneumonia then it's ok.And yes tiredness is expected for 4-5 days at least.  
Hey Brent,If you feeling low and drowsy with pneumonia then you must take appropriate antibiotics.If required might get admitted to get done i.v. treatment.

Hello sir,Seeing at your history would like to know more about your case.Want to look at your chest x ray first.and if its definitely diagnosed pnemonia, then in case you could be right that it could be viral pneumonia.but you can't stamp it as viral from clear phlegm. Get done white blood counts which will be within normal limits in case of viral and high in case of bacterial pneumonia. Also get done Procalcitonin and CRP level of your blood. it will give you final idea.And as you were smoker phlegm might be due to Bronchiectesis or COPD. rule out that.  
Do you have diagnosed it correctly ? Go for HRCT CHEST , or Bronchoscopy for same. take i.v. antibiotics and then oral. complete course of antibiotics. For costochondritis apply analgesics ointment on it along with systemic anti inflammatory drugs. Get done diagnosis proper. You will definitely able to work again.  
HiYes it might be but not completely.To be sure she should consult her doctor for further follow up.Wishes Dr.Jolanda  
HiIf a patient have pneumonia he should have cough with or without sputum,probably chest pain and breathlessness,anorexia,fever.But the signs and symptoms varies from patient to patient.Take careDr.jolanda  
Walking pneumonia is a non-medical term to describe a mild case of pneumonia. It is usually called atypical pneumonia because the disease is different from more serious cases of pneumonia caused by typical bacteria. it is often the result of a lung infection from a bacterial microorganism called Mycoplasma pneumoniae and generally treated with antibiotics. Mild infections are often not treated because they tend to clear on their own. With treatment, most people begin to feel better within a few days.  
Respected Sir, hi. Diagnosis of Pertussis is clinical usually,divided into 3 stages .1st stage (catarrhal) where runny nose, sneezing, low grade fever, occasional cough. 2nd stage (paroxysmal) bursts of coughing or numerous rapid coughs, difficult to expel thick mucus from airways in lungs , long respiratory effort with high-pitch breath sound , individual may have cyanosis with or without vomiting during severe attack, inbetween attacks, patient becomes normal.3rd stage is convalescent or recovery gradually from above all. overall period may range from 1-2 weeks to 10-12 weeks. In which cases diagnosis is not certain or require confirmation *Culture of bacterium Bordetella pertusis from nasal secretions *PCR test identifying genetic material from the bacterium in nasal secretions. Hope this clears your query dear madam, thanks regards take care, bye, wishing you fast speedy recovery from the same.  
Hi and welcome in HCMAccording to the history this might be a situation called *Nonresponding Pneumonia*It would be better to be hospitalized for further examinations like:CRPHemogramALT,ASTChest CT (if needed)ABGFor exploring better the situation and do the treatment in i/v route .If you have comorbidites they should be evaluated too.Sometimes when the other comorbidities are not well treated the pneumonia does not respond so well from the treatment.So please discuss with your doctor for the aboveRegardsDr.Jolanda  
Tingling in extremities may be a sign of peripheral neuropathy, wich is most of the cases caused by inflammatory injury to the nerves. Anti-TNF drugs, such as Humira, have been reported to be associated to this kind of injury, that can be potentialized when associated to steroids. You should visit your attending rheumathologist for physical evaluation and apropriate management.  
Lung whiteout and loss of heart outline are findings of chest x-ray compatible with many abnormal conditions affecting the lungs, like pneumonia, pleural effusion, acute respiratory distress syndrome among others. In the actual setting, your father is already receiving treatment to his pneumonia. All the other possibilities are probably been considerated and adressed by CCU staff. Weaning from mechanical ventilation is sometimes challenging because many factors can impair patients evolution, like how long he's been in MV, his nutrition status, his cardiovascular performance and resolution of the cause that led him to MV in the first place.  
Hello and thank you for asking in HCM I can understand your concern Don't worry so much. Your husband is under treatment for pneumonia according to the history and he has had fever several times.Now he feels better but he is not completely asymptomatic which means that the feeling he had might be due to an episode of temperature not so high .This shows that the treatment is doing well. But he has to be careful with the treatment to be correct as the doctor has prescribed ,no smoking and not to work in dust environment ,a lot of liquids too.Take careWish a fast recovery for your husband. Dr. Jolanda Pulmonologist  
It depends. It depends of your country and the state of coronavirus, in some places you need to have traveled recently to another country to get the test, and in another countrys you need to be tested right away after any symptoms. You should check your country phase of coronavirus Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
Yes. Avoid contact but ensure that they have food, supplies and able to slay at home. They should drink fluids and if they develop a fever, please call your PCP right away and also consider a virtual appointment with HT. Other symptoms to watch for include dry cough and shortness of breath. Use good hand washing and disinfect surfaces.  
Same measures Wear a mask, social distance as possible, try not to touch surfaces, keep hands clean. Best would still be not to travel if possible. Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
Current symptoms? You may have experienced Coronavirus infection. Please stay at home until well and without any signs of illness. Drink fluids, rest and monitor your temperature. .  
Take all precautions. Take all precautions possible to try to avoid catching Coronavirus. Wash your hands often with soap & water, avoid touching your eyes, nose & mouth, stay home as much as possible, cover your mouth & nose with tissue if you sneeze or cough, clean & disinfect frequently touched surfaces often & if you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing seek medical care.  
Stay home. Stay home for at least 7 days, rest, drink fluids and monitor your temperature. There is an overlap between flu and COVID-19 symptoms. Nasal congestion and absence of fever are not typically associated with COVID. Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
Being cautious best. Any medication that can increase the potential of viral infections should be avoided during a coronavirus outbreak such as we are seeing now. Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
Hard to say. In the absence of treatment I guess we grasp at things. This is definitely doing the rounds but as yet unproven. Most people recover from covid. So very very hard to trial. Most important right now is not to spread it. So stay home. Wash hands.  
HPV virus Human papiloma virus. You wont necessarily have them but you could have the virus. When last did you have a papsmear. THey can pick it up on that. Once we are out of lockdown get a papsmear. Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
Telephonic consult? Could well be another respiratory virus, I would stay home for now. Use this platform to consult either virtually or ask more questions. Use home medicine - decongestant and pain medication. STay away from any anti-inflammatories if possible. Keep up warm fluids. Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
Test for Covid-19. On this times better to be sure you don’t become contagious and spread the virus, try to get tested for Covid-19.  
Very unlikely It sounds more like a viral cold. covid does not present this way. treat the symptoms,consult GP if worse or if sputum changes color. Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
Diabetes + Covid-19. Because you are a Type I diabetic it means that you are at greater risk for complications if you contract Covid-19. If you have had a sore throat for a few days that gets worse every day, and if you have a fever over 100F, call your General Physician. .  
Isolate. No symptoms no test. You really do not need testing if there are no symptoms, but act like you are contagious. avoid contact with people for 14 days and only consult your GP if get symptoms.  
Probable flu. This definitely sounds like Influenza is starting.( Unless you have any obvious reason to suspect COVID-19,Malaria,Tick Bite Fever or Glandular Fever).Rest,Vitamin C and a suitable over the counter painkiller. I would advise avoiding Ibuprofen and other Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory medication.  
Unknown Without any details it's impossible to say. Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
Diabetes + Covid-19. Have you been diagnosed as a Diabetic, or just someone with slightly elevated A1C? Reports are that diabetics, especially males, are at greater risk. Follow all precautions that have been posted all over the internet and have been printed in newspapers. If you have a sore throat and a fever, call your General Physician and follow his/her directions completely.  
More detail. Do you have a temperature ?Have you traveled internationally or locally?Do you have a fever ?It is seeming to be becoming necessary to be more vigilant about COVID-19.I suggest you make an appointment to see a Doctor.  
Watch and wait. With very mild symptoms you do not need to be tested.Your temperature is important. if your symptoms worsen or a fever develops or you start coughing and shortness of breath you need to seek help. stay home and treat the symptoms with paracetamol.  
Covid and TB. Patients with a history of underlying lung disease do have a higher risk of morbidity and mortality with covid infection. It is important to self isolate and maintain social distancing as per the current protocols. Should you suspect covid infection get screened as early as possible.  
Overseas and Covid Yes,direct contact with anyone from Europe and travel history must get tested. There are drive in facilities in Johannesburg.Check the net for testing places in CT Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
Not at all. If you are a well controlled diabetic then you will be fine. You will have an equal risk of getting it. If you are poorly controlled then you are more at risk of it complicating. But boost your immunity and stay at home. Get online shopping. Keep bags outside and sterilize everything coming into your home - entire item. KEep using this forum for questions. :)  
Hard to say. Is the mucous coloured or clear? Try to access health advice as you are. Stay home. It could be covid but if you are fairly asymptomatic stay home and keep asking questions on this platform. It is safer for you and others. Treat symptomatically for now. And keep asking on here.  
Unlikely It could be, however going out right now is dangerous to you and others. If you don't have it yet going out risks getting it. If you have it you can spread it. Try to access a thorough consult on the phone or virtually. Keep chatting we are here for you. Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
Most likely not c Most likely sinusitis or seasonal allergy. Try to access a telelphonic or virtual consult to discuss thoroughly with someone. For now stay home stay safe. Treat yourself and all in your family as if they have covid for now =it's safer. Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
No not now GEt telephonic consult via this or other forums. Not indicated to be tested right now. Use medication you have at home to treat symptoms right now. Use this forum if symptoms change. Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
YEs This virus clings to everything especially hairs. Either wash your beard a few times a day and spray with alcohol or shave off. Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
Likely not corona. Sounds more like seasonal allergy or a mild cold. GArgle with warm salt water and use meds you have at home. Ask questions on this forum - don't go out unless you really really have to.  
Yes. VEry very important for you to stay in quarantine and not go and shop. Also make sure anything that comes into your house is sanitized. EVery single thing. Sanitize. KEep 2 m away from everyone and wear a buff or home made mask that covers your nose and mouth. Be safe. Be positive. We will get through this.  
Infectious for 3w. If you had corona virus you are infectious for 3 weeks. So you need to stay 2 m away from loved ones. Stay home. Get someone else to shop for you. Stay home. Wear a buff over your nose and mouth. Do not touch your face, mouth or nose. Wash hands for 20 seconds every 20 min.  
Booster vaccinations. You should have had a booster at 12 years and that lasts for 10 years. If your last Tdap was at 6yrs then you are overdue. I agree with waiting for after the COVID pandemic unless you have an injury that would require tetanus immunity. Stay safe. .  
This could well be very normal. One can get pain on day 14 during ovulation and before and during the period. Use panado for this and once we are through this corona virus you can use anti-inflammatories. Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
No. The vaccines prevent bacterial pneumonia. They have no effect on viral pneumonia.  
It may help. Coronavirus infections may make individuals more susceptible to catching other viral or bacterial infections, esp. if there are underlying respiratory conditions such as asthma or COPD, cardiac conditions or immunocompromised states. Flu vaccines may afford a certain level of protection to kids, but they do not protect against all strains of the influenza virus. Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
Your symptoms sound more like seasonal allergy. Treat as such, your pharmacist can assist. Try to do this over the phone and collect if possible. Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
Contact Dr Rather get hold of your regular GP and discuss over the telephone regarding this issue. DO NOT STOP OR DO THIS ON YOUR OWN. Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
Depends-all factors. Type I diabetics can be more fragile when they have any type of infection unfortunately. If you are younger & do not smoke & do not have other chronic problems, your increased risk may be minimal. Eating balanced diet, keeping glucose controlled, getting adequate exercise (including fresh air outdoors), & adequate sleep all should help protect you from severe consequences, but be very careful ! .  
Probably not Covid. May be allergic, bacterial sinus infection, a different virus, a narrow upper jaw with partial airway obstruction, or other causes. Call your General Physician and check if they want to see you. See your Dentist to evaluate if your upper jaw is too narrow and if you need to see an Orthodontist. Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
Difficult times. This is a difficult question. Many workers like you wear masks, gloves, stand 6 feet from others, take off work clothes on entering their home, wash meticulously. Read more tips from Covid19 hotlines. Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
Not necessarily You need to consult an endocrinologist for advice about diet, weight control, and medication for controlling A1c. It is not feasible to provide more useful suggestions without talking to you, performing physical examination and may be some test.Wish you good health! Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
Seek help. Contact to your doctor or go to ER for trouble to breath. If you go to ER they test you for covid 19. Your mother also can be tested if symptomtic.  
Sounds risky. Using symptoms of fever, cough, or runny nose to screen for COVID-19 is not accurate because colds and flu have such symptoms. COVID testing is by nasal swab, but there's a shortage of test kits in this pandemic. Only local resources know local testing sites, times, restrictions. Even a negative test does not guarantee one does not have COVID-19. Safest for people to stay away from ICU patients.  
Break. At 39 your risk for severe infections is very low. A strategy that I recommend is taking in information daily, but get away from it. Practice prudent precautions. In my off times away from ER (still practicing front line ER) I focus my mind on my cooking, planning my garden, engage with my friends and loved ones and read. https://www.healthtap.com/blog/covid-19-care-guidelines  
One sign On treatment for bacterial pneumonia, fever will usually decline within 2 days. A follow up chest image may be indicated. If you would like to upload her CT and clinical information to an inbox consultation with HT, we can provide an opinion. Sometimes there is slow resolution of a pneumonia, particularly with underlying medical conditions. The test results should be back soon. Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
Delay/virtual . Virtual get togethers should be considered. Keep a distance of at least 6 feet between persons who are not in your household. .  
Consider chest image. Pneumonia may occur and if you continue to spike fevers, please see your PCP for a chest image and reevaluation. Testing for additional bacterial and viral causes may be performed at the same time. Stay at home at least for three days after the fever has broken and avoid contact with others. .  
No There is not enough data to support it's use. More clinical trials are needed Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
Wait for now Wait for now, keep talking on this platform. Stay safe. Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
Wait My advice would be wait and don't risk exposure and spread right now. Quarantine. Safe stay. We are here for you on this platform. Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
Arrange testing Stay home, provide fluids and ibuprofen after checking his temperature. If he does not look well to you, please arrange a virtual or in person appointment with your pediatrician. Avoid contact with others, use good hand washing and consider testing for Influenza and Coronavirus. Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
COVID-19? It sounds like your mom is in good hands. If she has COVID, they will know how to treat it. If the pneumonia is beleived to be bacterial, they will treat with antibiotics. There is no proved effective treatment for coronavirus itself. Ask her doctors if she is a candidate for remdesivir -- not proved effective but sometimes available on a "compassionate" basis for severely ill patients. Good luck.  
Water and soap It is best, providing available easily. Trying not to touch shared places would also protect to some extent. Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
It actually works. As does washing your hands with soap and water. All the germs die after using it, so they become harmless. Sanitizer and washing your hands will help protect you, but you can still catch COVID-19 through your mouth and nose and inhaled into the lungs. Social distance and quarantine as needed.  
Flu vaccine Any flu vaccine will cause your immune system to respond. I advise,if your decision is to be vaccinated,to do it over a period of 6 weeks..I like a little bit on day 1 ,then more 2 weeks later and more two weeks later still.That way you get the full killed vaccine ,and your body develops an immune response with its ability still intact to fight Covid 19 if necessary. Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
Stay home. Right now stay home, keep reporting here. THEre should be home to home testing coming soon. Mild corona virus is easy to treat at home. Treat everyone right now as if they have it, including everyone in your home.  
Read our blog post. Household members should stay in another room or be separated from the quarantined as much as possible. They should use a separate bedroom and bathroom, if available. Prohibit visitors to the home. You and the quarantined should each wear a face mask if you are in the same room. (3/26/20) Read https://www.healthtap.com/blog/covid-19-care-guidelines  
No testing now YOur children are going to be fine, there have not been any children that have required drastic measures. MAke sure you stay 2 m away and wash hands and surfaces, disinfect surfaces constantly. Ask questions on here, we are here buy you need to stay home right now. Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
If you meet criteria You should test if you meet the criteria for testing, which currently states that you should have symptoms (cough/fever/shortness of breath/sore throat) PLUS contact with a confirmed or suspected case of Covid-19. If you do not have a contact, then best would be to isolate yourself (which you will be doing on lockdown anyway). Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
Perhaps not now. SEe how you go, going out right now is really a big risk. WE are here and can communicate during the lockdown period. THe government are making more tests available and safely so. Trust our government. Stay home right now.

Travel is a risk Any travel is a risk, that is how this has spread so yes I would advise you telephonically consult with a doctor and see what they advise is best right now. But locking down requires all of us to stay put to stop transmission. I mean international travel is a risk to get covid and from international folk, especially recently. Travel right now to expose yourself and others is also a risk. Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
Shout . What are your symptoms? There are short supply of tests and only if you absolutely need a test at this stage. STay at home, disinfect everything especially any shopping coming from outside your home. Ask questions on this forum. STay at home right now.  
Symptoms If you are infected, symptoms will emerge: tiredness, dry cough, fever worsening over 5-14 days. You will also become more infective so self-isolation and good hygiene are vital.Only be concerned about COVID-19 if: - You have been in contact with someone with a conformed diagnosis of COVID-19 - You have visited a high risk area - Symptoms worsen and include persistent fever and dry cough Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
COVID-19 and RA. Some anecdotal data showed that chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine might have activity against COVID-19. Observation from China Wuhan noted that patients with RA and on these medications had low incidence of COVID-19 infection. There is however no definite proof yet at this time. In terms of whether you can stop methotrexate, you better discuss with your rheumatologist for the benefit and risk. .  
After symptoms show. As per the NICD Guidelines for Clinical Management of Suspected or Confirmed COVID-19 Disease, "Those with mild disease may be de-isolated 14 days after symptom onset, while those with severe disease may be de-isolated 14 days after achieving clinical stability (e.g. once supplemental oxygen is discontinued)". [Available at: http://www.nicd.ac.za/diseases-a-z-index/covid-19/covid-19-guidelines/]  
Viral infection. Most likely a viral infection but possibly allergyI advise a doctor consultation You may need treatment with an antihistamine, and decongestantOnly be concerned about COVID-19 if: - You have been in contact with someone with a conformed diagnosis of COVID-19 - You have visited a high risk area - Symptoms worsen and include persistent fever and dry cough.  
Viral infection. Most likely a non-specific viral infection.Check your temperature.If persistently raised an symptoms don't clear in 7 days, consult your doctor.Most likely a non-specific viral infection.Only be concerned about COVID-19 if:You have been in contact with someone with a conformed diagnosis of COVID-19You have visited a high risk areaSymptoms worsen and include persistent fever and dry cough.  
Lab if necessary Most commercial labs such as Lancet, Ampath and Pathcare can test. But the labs are stretched and test kits in short supply. Only tests if:You have symptoms that are not resolvingYou have been in contact with someone diagnosed with COVID-19You have traveled from a high risk area Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
Probably not. much more important is what her exposure is to anyone who has COVID19 or traveler from a highly infected area.fever >100.4F and respiratory symptoms are more common with COVID 19 than vomiting.  
Best to stay home Right now stay home, consult here. Disinfect everything and stay safe. We are here to answer your questions. Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
Viral respiratory You likely have a viral respiratory tract infection. Manage with paracetamol and gargle with salt water or Disprin. Everyone is concerned about Corona virus. This is unlikely unless you have been in contact with someone who has been diagnosed or has traveled from a high risk area. In any event, isolate yourself from others, stay at home and adopt strict hygiene measures: hand washing, alcohol use Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
Absolutely. Good morningWithout being rude, you are quite right to stay well away. Also be stringent about hand washing, sanitizing and avoiding contact with your face and other people. Monitor any symptoms.  
COVID-19? You won't like to hear this, but loss of smell (anosmia) or taste often is the first symptom of COVID-19, the epidemic coronavirus infection. Nasal congestion also could go along with this. And you probably know that COVID-19 is currently a big problem in NYC. He should contact his doctor right away.  
TO be sure, GET TESTED!  
Virus. These symptoms are characteristic of a viral upper respiratory tract infection and treatment is resting, drinking adequate amounts of fluids,taking Tylenol. Worrisome symptoms would be shaking chills, higher fever, chest discomfort with deeper cough,shortness of breath or wheezing which should prompt a call to your MD for instructions. If you live where Covid19 is present,or been exposed get test.  
Data. From Data from China there has been association between worse infection and diarrhea. The seems to be a worse inflammatory response associated with people who have diarrhea. .  
Safer to quarantine. Screening procedures to identify who has COVID-19 are not very reliable and vary depending on location (city, county, state, nation) and entity type (airline boarding, border control, clinic, school, etc.). Three months into the epidemic, the safest is to self-quarantine for 14-21 days upon arrival. Reliable test for virus is via nasal swab, but there's a shortage of test kits in most places.  
Call Dr. by video Throat pain can be from a strep throat infection (antibiotics needed), a cold or influenza (antibiotics usually not used), or from some other cause such as allergies or irritants. Usually, a person sees the doctor (call first) if the sore throat is bothersome, recurrent, or doesn't go away quickly. COVID-19 infections tend to have cough, whereas strep usually lacks cough but has more throat pain. Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
Diabetes Type 1 diabetes may be an autoimmune disorder, but if well controlled one's immunity and ability to handle infections should be ok. Poorly controlled diabetics, especially with complications of kidney disease and vascular disorders, degrees of dehydration and poor tissue status are at risk for infections partly because the skin barrier to pathogens is impaired. In my experience most type 1's do ok Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
Request a mask Avoid contact with others, request a mask and ask those around you to wear a mask. A desk more than 6 feet away from others is another measure of safety. Use good hand washing and keep surfaces, including your phone and computer clean. Continue your steroids as prescribed. Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
Unlikely. Follow this guideline, but I do not see evidence you need to isolate. https://www.healthtap.com/blog/covid-19-care-guidelines  
Infection Looking at the data people that have the virus can spread it. There are cases of viral spread that have been linked from sign of having virus to up to 10 to 14 days prior. Probably within days of infection your are a problem. Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
Minimal outside time To avoid spread of COVID-19, use precautions such as staying home as much as possible Avoid contact with others until the infection rate begins to decline. Monitor your temperature, rest and drink fluids. On day 7 post contact if you have no symptoms, most likely you are fine. Continue to use good hand washing and keep surfaces clean. Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
Covid. Data from frozen food shows that there is no transfer of virus via food sources this way. .  
Not as fragile as one might hope. -80 C does not kill it +56 C does kill it Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
Not as fragile. as one might hope. -80 C does not kill it +56 C does kill it.  
Alcohol for Covid-19. Washing your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds is extremely effective. Using an alcohol based hand sanitizer is a good second line of defense. Sanitizer contains emollient to help prevent dehydration. Straight alcohol doesn't. Follow all of the other published rules.  
Yes you can,depends. Corona Virus treatment so far is symptomatic and supportive. It really depends what you treat with Disprin/Compral.You are they do not have Ibuprofen. Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
TAKE CARE. 1. Wash your hands2. Stay home as much as you can3. Control your glucose levels4. Meditate or search for breathing exercises.  
No,you shouldnt. Unless you have a history of international travel recently or were in contact with someone who has tested positive for Corona Virsu. Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
Not at all. Your  
No Kids are very resilient and the best fighters of this. Stay home and stay safe. People spread this virus. Your baby will be fine, I don't think hoarseness is corona at all :) keep asking questions as you need to Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
Sort of. If you are having sex with someone who has Covid-19 you are quite at risk of getting it. High likelihood if kissing and having intercourse but it may not be transmitted through intercourse but the closeness in an intimate situation like that with someone who is infected gives a high likelihood of transmission.  
TRANSMISIÓN VIH Solamente ciertos líquidos corporales —la sangre, el semen, el líquido preseminal, las secreciones rectales etc — de una persona que tiene el VIH pueden transmitir el virus. Si ambos tienen la certeza con una prueba confirmatoria de que no están infectados y son monogamos no tienen por qué contraerlo. Sin embargo tener relaciones sexuales sin protección pueden contraer otro ETS Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
May call Dr on video Throat symptoms can be from strep throat infection (antibiotics needed), a cold or influenza (antibiotics usually not used), or from some other cause such as allergies or irritants. Usually, a person sees a doctor (call first) if the throat issue is bothersome, recurrent, or doesn't go away quickly. COVID-19 infections tend to have cough, whereas strep usually lacks cough but has more throat pain. Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
Not well stablished. For now, it is known that having chronic disease, including diabetes (not specified type), increases the risk of death. However, the outbreak is so new that evidence is not enough robust to give a number yet. Anyway, It is recommendable to assume that you are at higher risk and strict protection should be taken.  
Yes My opinion is yes, but the criteria for testing is quite stringent right now. Perhaps telephonically consult your doctor if possible to discuss more fully. My opinion would be to access testing. Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
Not yet. Only if your respiration rate (google that) per minute goes above 25 and you really feel you are battling to breath. Use this forum if your symptoms change. We are here for you.  
Can call Dr on video. Throat pain can be from a strep throat infection (antibiotics needed), a cold or influenza, EB virus, or from some other cause such as allergies, irritants, or acid reflux. Usually, a person sees the doctor (call first) if the sore throat is bothersome, recurrent, or doesn't go away quickly. COVID-19 infections tend to have cough, whereas strep usually lacks cough but has more throat pain.  
Dizziness. Yes. Please contact your doctor since they know you better. He may want to test you for the virus. There are other reasons you may be dizzy as well. .  
HArd to say If you have access to a telephonic consult then rather do that to start. If you have access to testing you can do that. Do you have to work at the moment? I would discuss it with your consultant. Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
Fever Antibiotics are supposed to prevent fevers, not cause them. If, however, you are having an allergic reaction to the medication it can cause a fever. But so can viral diseases (common cold, Flu, Covid-19, etc. ) that are not treatable with antibiotics that are designed to treat bacterial infections. Call your General Physician and report your symptoms. Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
Yes. Protection. It is not enough symptoms to say that you are a suspect case of COVID19; but, independently of this, if you have been in contact with a case, or you present persistent cough (with or without sputum), shortness of breath, wheezing, or you have a chronic disease like diabetes, hypertension, low immune system or cancer, should ask for medical attention. And use all the protection measures.  
Questions. Have you travelled, been in contact with a corona virus patient? Could very well be stress right now. WE are all really stressed and confused at this point in time. Be kind to yourself, breathe, do some exercise. :) We are here for you.  
Not stablished. All caution measures should be applied, including social distancing, sanitizer, and protection mask when crowded places are inevitable. Although MBL deficiency causes increased susceptibility to infections, mostly in people with chronic diseases, COVID-19 outbreak is so recent that a specific relationship with this disease has not been stablished. Anyway, have extreme caution and use protection.  
Test if you can If you have availability get a telephonic consult and get a test. Testing capability is stretched right now self quarantine and keep in touch on this forum for now. Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
Protection. Stay at home as much as possible, clean your hands and your children hands after any contact with people, alcohol is very helpful; avoid touching your face when you are not sure your hands are clean. In crowded places, wear protection like N95 surgical mask. Playing outside is ok, but apply these measures and stay way 6 ft from any unknown health status person.  
NSAIDs. OTC NSAIDs can help with pain and inflammation. Please try calling a local oral surgeon. Most medical offices are open for emergencies only, and this probably falls into that category.  
Not particularly . The muscles involved in coughing & vomiting are similar & young children often have difficulty not vomiting if they cough hard enough. I would concentrate of maintaining her fluid balance & see if she gradually improves. These are often simple viruses but need to be monitored closely.  
Call  
Wrong place to ask This is the HT public site where volunteer docs primarily in the USA answer health questions. We do not do referrals/provide notes or prescriptions or any other form of direct service. You need to contact a local provider in your country/location for such needs. Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
No. It is not... yet That new is based in a paper https://www.healthtap.com/blog/covid-19-care-guidelines plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1006140) which says that inhibition of leukotrienes (which Singulair-Montelukast inhibits) in mice, not humans, had a protection effect against death caused by Influenza A virus pneumonia. Further research is needed to ensure that this works for influenza, and even more for ?SARS-CoV-2. Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
Symptoms. First, symptomatic treatment at home, plenty fluids and rest. Also apply all the preventive measures of social distancing. But if you are aware of any possible contact with an infected person, it is difficult to breath, fever does not low with bath or paracetamol, you are diabetic or with another chronic disease like hypertension, clinical attention should be asked for as soon as possible.  
Distance Staying separated by 6 feet can make a difference! The following guideline should https://www.healthtap.com/blog/covid-19-care-guidelines healthtap.com/blog/covid-19-care-guidelines/preventing-covid-19 Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
Isolate sick people Throat pain can be from a strep throat (antibiotics needed), a cold or influenza, or from some other cause such as allergies or irritants. Usually, a person sees the doctor (call first) if the sore throat is bothersome, recurrent, or doesn't go away quickly. The flu or COVID-19 usually have cough, fever, body aches; whereas strep is mainly sore throat. Can call doctor by video or phone. (3/25/20) Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
Doctor can examine Throat symptoms can be from a strep throat infection (antibiotics are needed), a cold or influenza, or from some other cause such as allergies, irritants, or acid reflux. Usually, one sees the doctor if the sore throat is bothersome, recurrent, or doesn't go quickly (mainly to check for strep throat). During this COVID-19 pandemic, doctors want patients to call by video or phone first. (3/25/20) Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
Same as usual During this COVID-19 pandemic, the other infections like colds, flus, and sinus infections can still happen. The over-the-counter treatments have not changed. COVID-19 virus is so new that there has not been much verified research yet, so stick with what meds worked in the past. See the blog post... https://www.healthtap.com/blog/covid-19-care-guidelines (3/25/20) Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
Symptoms. Symptoms lasting for a week that are getting better sounds like process is resolving. Covid testing would not be indicated. You should follow the following guidelines: https://www.healthtap.com/blog/covid-19-care-guidelines  
If you are dying Everything is in motion and medical decisions are fluid, so you won't know until it happens. That's because a healthy person under 50 won't die (has maybe half a percent chance of dying) from COVID-19, but a guy aged 70-80 has a 7-8% chance of dying from this... about the same as a non-elderly diabetic. That means the old guy and the diabetic both have about a 92-93% chance of NOT dying. (3/25/20) Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
Any contagiousness A person with any signs of respiratory infection or gastrointestinal infection should be isolated to prevent spread of his infection. Allergies can cause symptoms similar to infection symptoms, which means a person with allergy symptoms at this pandemic time should also be isolated. Note that if every person is isolated for 3-4 weeks, the pandemic stops because virus transmission stops. (3/25/20) Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
Maybe Such a mask helps protect others from any respiratory material you exhale or cough but does not filter out the virus. Only high end medical & industrial masks (P95/N95)would filter that. Your best protection is frequent hand washing and not touching your face/mouth/nose with contaminated fingers., Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
Symptoms Sore throat less associated with Covid. Possibilities include strep, flu, covid or other virus. The following guide should https://www.healthtap.com/blog/covid-19-care-guidelines Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
Diabetes and COVID. In all cases, the better the blood sugar is controlled, the better the immune system can function. Eating healthy, exercising as tolerated, and control blood sugars are close to normal as your doctor advises, is the best plan. .  
Maybe/not They estimate as many as 80% of those testing positive in the under 40 age group have minor or no symptoms. Having a non respiratory chronic illness does not increase your risk substantially. Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
Get tested. If you can not find a place to get tested self-quarantine yourself for 2 weeks. You can use over the counter drugs for symptomatic treatment in the mean time. If sore throat get worse this could be strep throat need a culture to be taken from your throat by your doctor followed by antibiotic. If shortness of breath gets worse call the hospital for the inpatient treatment could be for Covid-19.  
Flu. I think you a probably right. Body aches not as common with Covid. If no significant SOB follow the following: https://www.healthtap.com/blog/covid-19-care-guidelines Talk to your provider Flu test may help, but management typically best conservative. Certainly if worseing SOB be seen. Remeber at 29 risk for severe infection is low either way. .  
Covid 19 testing . Hi at the moment it is only recommended that you test for COVID 19 if you have a close contact that has tested positive for the virus or have had recent international travel in the last 14 days. If your symptoms are worsening or your asthma is uncontrolled you should call your GP rooms or attend your nearest emergency room.  
Check online There are many resources online about the symptoms of COVID-19. The most important questions relate to travel history and the symptoms you are experiencing. If you suspect that you may have COVID-19, self-isolate as soon as possible and call your local doctor or testing site. You can also check out https://www.healthtap.com/blog/covid-19-care-guidelines or call 0800 029 999 Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
Well done. YOu are a star level headed, keep going at home and support everyone over your well sterilised phone. ;)  
Stay home Hi. If you are concerned about COVID-19, please call the hotline on 0800 029 999, see the FAQs on https://www.healthtap.com/blog/covid-19-care-guidelines gov.za/coronavirus/faq or https://www.healthtap.com/blog/covid-19-care-guidelines Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
Virtual consult. Best to do a virtual consult, you can through this platform. TEsting is the only way to know. Self isolation is very important right now unless you need urgent medical care. .  
Yes. Could well be and that is very normal. SEe how you go, you do have some worrying symptoms. Try to do a telephonic consult and if you have access get tested. In the interim self isolate and listen to Cyril's advice. Be calm, we are here.  
Odd comment Since all countries have reported cases of Covid-19 the question is a bit inconsistent with current fact. Any and all people should self quarantine if they had a known exposure in any setting. I would not consider anyone traveling from all areas either exposed or a risk to others. The hysteria of this idea is worse than the disease. Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
Can give Dr. a call Throat pain can be from a strep throat infection (antibiotics needed), a cold or influenza (antibiotics usually not used), or from some other cause such as allergies or irritants. Usually, a person sees the doctor (call first) if the sore throat is bothersome, recurrent, or doesn't go away quickly. COVID-19 infections tend to have cough, whereas strep usually lacks cough but has more throat pain. Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
They don't . Unless you are using high end medical or industrial masks they do not protect you from any such virus. They prevent your cough or expired air from infecting others. Any scarf/fabric homemade mask or similar device will do the same. You protect yourself more by washing your hands often & not touching your face/mouth/nose with contaminated fingers.  
Periauricular pain May be otitis ear infection or mastoiditis infection in the bone behind the ear. Could call health tap prime for video assessment and antibiotic prescription. Sometimes you may need IM or IV antibiotics. Call Healthtap Prime or MD today ( even with corona ongoing you need treatment for this today). Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
Nasal rinses For allergic symptoms, nasal saline and an oral antihistamine are often helpful for controlling symptoms. Continue to monitor your temperature and report fever and/or shortness of breath to your PCP. Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
It will.... But it will take some time to break the chain of infection, to find a cure, and to find a vaccine. It is stressful for everyone. One way to look at it is that we are all in this together, irregardless of political party, race, or religion. As a people, we can overcome a simple virus and be stronger as a whole. You are not alone, millions of others share your concerns. Hang in there....  
Telephonic consult. get tested but you need to consult first, telephonically and get access to a test if you can, stay at home treat with panado only and a lot of fluids, rest :)  
Covid 19 The incubation period of covid 19 is 2-14 days and you're past that. However if fever, chills, heavier cough, or breathing difficulties develop, call your MD for instructions. For now, drink adequate fluids, gargle with warm salt water. I recommend also using zinc lozenges and take acetaminophen. Don't infect others regardless of what type of infection you have. Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
Virus. You have a viral respiratory tract infection and the absence of fever is reassuring at this time. Should fever or shortness of breath develop and if you're in an area where covid 19 is present, you should then call your MD for instructions. For now, drink adequate fluids, gargle with warm salt water. I also recommend using zinc lozenges and take acetaminophen. .  
Common flu Hello.During the coronavirus outbreak the best thing you can do for yourself, your family and your comunity is to stay home. Don't go to school or work, stay at home and isolate yourself specially from the elders.Do whatever you do when you have the common cold.Drink a lot of fluids, take Tylenol for the sore throat and please DON'T go to the doctor unless you're feeling shortness of breath Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
Basics Fever is a normal body response when ill that increases circulation & oxygen supply to the tissues so natural healing comes faster.I would never treat minor fevers around 38 nor would I alternate fever meds. One or the other would be all I use when needed. New data supports avoiding all ibuprofen products when corona virus may be present. Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
No. The coronavirus apparently only needs to be in contact with the mucosa of the lips, mouth, nose and eyes to infect someone.Please stay home and follow the recommendations of the local authorities.  
Uncertain data. Hello.The data available about the coronavirus and ibuprofen are inconclusive.Nevertheless you should visit a pain specialist doctor for the manage of your pain. It's been established that Ibuprofen and other NSAID'S taken in large doses or long periods cause kidney damage.  
Slim kans van Virus.

It is unlikely. Mefical personnel are trained to avoid these situations.Nevertheless recommend her to take off her clothes when she gets home and go directly to take a shower. Also is recommended to disinfect all the areas she touches before washing her hands, like door knobs and surfaces.  
Stay home Do whatever you do with a regular flu. Drink a lot of fluids, use acetaminophen/paracetamol (tylenol) for the fever and sore throat, eat/drink citrus and please stay home and away from the elders. Follow the recommendation of your local authorities.Only go to medical services if you feel shortness of breath and use masks if you feel sick and need to go out of your house Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
7 days. Stay at home for 7 days without symptoms. Monitor your temperature, rest, drink fluids If symptoms develop, please notify your physician and test. .  
Not advised to test . The test currently used is a genetic test which test for the virus genetics. Therefor if you are tested while asymptomatic, it will not test positive, even though you might actually be infected.Rather stay under self quarantine and test if you show some signs.  
Symptoms. So you are worried that you might have Covid-19. You may also have common cold or influenza. Call hour General Physician. Report your symptoms. They will direct you to proper care.  
Depend. Hello.High risk population for covid-19 are people more than 60 years old or with pre-existing condition like heart or lung disease.If you feel you have the flue stay home for your own good and the whole community. Unless you feel shortness of breath or don't go to medical services.  
Covid. Top symptoms for COVID include fever, dry cough and SOB. Actually sore throat not so common. Follow this https://www.healthtap.com/blog/covid-19-care-guidelines  
Risk. High risk would be smoker, 60 or older and with medical conditions- heart, lung, kidney. If you are not having significant SOB self isolation best to do and treat for flu symtpoms-rest, fluids, tylenol or ibuprofen if needed. https://www.healthtap.com/blog/covid-19-care-guidelines Tests are being reserved for those with significant symptoms. .  
Call your doctor Call your doctor's office for instructions Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
Might be more severe. People with diabetes can have more fragile immune systems with difficulty fighting infections, so if you contract coronavirus you might be at greater risk for breathing complications. Any serious illness can affect blood sugar control in diabetics also. I recommend taking extra precautions to minimize contact with people so as to avoid contacting the virus. .  
Food. This link will help! https://www.healthtap.com/blog/covid-19-care-guidelines general food is not a problem. Unless you are dining on bats in Wuhan! Here is a good article on https://www.healthtap.com/blog/covid-19-care-guidelines  
Limited risk From my reading the corona virus is limited in the animals it infests to varieties of bats and snakes. I would not put your dog or cat on such a list. Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
In pandemic times... The COVID-19 infection is worldwide, in all but some isolated areas. The goal is to keep people separate so that the clinics and hospitals are not overwhelmed. Patients with medical symptoms should see their primary care doctor on VIDEO or by PHONE, and get instructed to go to a clinic or ER only if not treatable by video or phone. Symptoms of COVID-19 are often the same as a cold or the flu.  
CoVid. https://www.healthtap.com/blog/covid-19-care-guidelines  
Self-quarantine. Try self-quarantine for 14 days; call your health care provider if you start having symptoms to get instructions regarding testing, self-quarantine and possible hospitalization then follow through!  
? telephonic consult If you are able, consult telephonically with your GP. If not, do not go into public places, rather get symptomatic treatment - let someone who is well do this as swiftly as they can. Otherwise continue consulting on this forum. We can help you. If you have access to a test this is the ONLY way to know if you truely have it. Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
Hard to say Very hard to say. Stay home. Stay safe. Get someone to buy you symptomatic medication and feel free to post on here again. Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
No If you know you have seasonal allergy treat that. Get as much medicine as you might need for a month regarding this. If you do not fit criteria (google) then no testing for now. Stay home and stay safe. Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
Corona virus If you are symptomatic and not SOB you should not need tested. Testing in itself does not change the course and at this time and it does not lead to a specific beneficial action. If fever and SOB the testing guides inpatient therapy. Follow the following https://www.healthtap.com/blog/covid-19-care-guidelines https://www.healthtap.com/blog/covid-19-care-guidelines Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
Try our other forum. You have posted on our free, public, informational forum, where doctors do not see patient charts nor give medical care. Try a private consultation where doctors can see you on video. Also, in the US certain medications (but not all) can be prescribed or temporarily refilled, depending on individual circumstances. Start over on your screen, click on Care, then Talk-to-Doctor. (Mar. 2020)  
Testing If asymptomatic testing unlikely to be done. The following guide should help: https://www.healthtap.com/blog/covid-19-care-guidelines Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
Hard to say New Zealand is definitely lower risk than Europe. Your best bet is to stay home, with masks on (home made) follow hygiene. If you need more help ask another question here. If you have access to testing you could do it but I think we need the tests for folk who are more ill at this stage. Hope this makes sense. Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
Need more info. Have you travelled or come into contact with a corona virus patient ?  
Avoid contact. Stay at home for at least 7 days from the onset or symptoms, or for at least three days following fever whichever is longer in duration. Cover your cough, monitor your temperature. Watch for signs of worsening including fever, shortness of breath or worsening cough.  
Hard to answer If not ill assume you have it and behave as if you do, wear a bandanna over nose and mouth and if you have access to testing then do it. If not stay home and boost immunity. Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
No. Most doctors are rescheduling non-essential surgeries, procedures and visits. You don't want to be in a doctor's office with a bunch of people who may or may not be infected with the Coronavirus. Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
Sounds like viral. Sounds viral but not corona however healthcare workers are high risk by being exposed to ill populations. I would stay home so that you do not cross infect. If you have access to a test then get that self isolate and monitor your symptoms. Post on here if confused. .  
Cough/fever? Please stay at home and avoid contact with others for one more day at least. If there is a fever, remain at home for at least three days after the fever is gone. At this point, if you are otherwise healthy, cover your cough, monitor your temperature and please stay home.Watch for signs of secondary infection, including fever, worsening cough and shortness of breath. Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
No. It is currently not possible but hopefully house to house testing coming according to Cyril Ramaphosa last night. You can get tested at some clinics, safest right now is to stay at home unless you are imminently unwell. If safe and in as much isolation as possible you can be tested at lancet and ampath, due to capacity stretching they are now only testing people who fit the criteria. .  
Yes. Yes you should come but it will not be a consultation depending the treatment you taking. If it is for HIV you will need to go to the lab for for bloods and if it is for hormone replacement there is no need for consultation but either way you have to call the practice reception to check f DR is available.  
Medications. I am unaware of any contraindications to either ibuprofen or paracetamol. You can take either. When I get sick I like to take both. One can be taken every 4 hours and the other every 6 hours. .  
Concern Diabetes if controlled well typically should not be an issue. I realize there are some conflicting information, but I think the evidence shows that if diabetes controled your immune system still reacts appropriately and not an issue. Arrythmia in itself not and issue. Your age is 60 and that starts to be category of concern with 3% mortality rate. If you do not smoke that is the key. Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
No. Don't go to work you could unknowinly spread the virus. We are all effectively on lock down and the sooner the better if you THINK you have it stay home, if you ave access to testing then get tested BUT we are running out of tests (to my knowledge) if you deteriorate send a message here and I will advise. DO not go to work.  
Ingrown toenail An ingrown toenail can make your foot numb. I do ER and it is a procedure I will do. However, many primary providers will do the procedure and podiatrists are a good choice. I do not recommend digging into it at home. However, to prevent future toenail problems do not wear pointed shoes, and let toenails grow to tip of toe and keep at that length. Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
Keep isolated The baby very likely has the infection. However, the data are very reassuring on children less than 10 year old. I am certain there has been no deaths recorded. Treat as you would if the baby had a cold. Follow the following isolation guidelines: https://www.healthtap.com/blog/covid-19-care-guidelines I think you will find this improving in a few days. Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
Dont think c This is a different problem. Dont think it is covid. Which is good news. What are your other symptoms? Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
Hard to say. It does look like it is true. We are in an unprecedented time right now. What we know we are trying to convey. Switch to panado or napacod for now if possible.  
Nearly normal Assuming you are not on any immunosuppresive therapy your risk is normal. but make sure you do social distancing Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
Keep non smoking. If you have no exposure history to COVID 19, your cough is probably not infection. keep up the good work and do not smoke or vape.  
Probably not COVID19 early COVID 19 may not have a fever, but usually does by on average 5 days after exposure. what is your exposure to COVID? that is more important to determine the possibility of developing COVID 19 Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
Yes like most lung infections there will be changes in the lung structure, probably microscopically and may not be seen on X-rays, Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
COVID 19 is airborne. COVID 19 is primarily an airborne acquired infection. the number of potentially infected viruses dissipate by 6 feet.  
If it's just from... If cough and headache are just from a mild cold, then the over-the-counter cold medicines are what people usually try. However, some illnesses such as strep throat, the flu, or pandemic coronavirus also have these same symptoms, but need evaluation. It is best to contact one's primary care doctor by video or phone first during this pandemic. For emergencies, call the local emergency #). (3/24/20) Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
Usually does not Throat symptoms can be from strep throat infection (antibiotics are needed), a cold or other virus (antibiotics usually not used), allergies, irritants, sinusitis, stomach reflux when asleep, etc. .. One usually sees the doctor if the throat issue is bothersome, recurrent, or doesn't go away quickly. A strep throat swab test can easily diagnose strep throat. Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
Rash. How long has it been going on? May be food allergies, most common are dairy products so you could try a week with no dairy and see if there is a change, others allergens include eggs , wheat. Could try Zyrtec children's 2 ml once a day and see if it helps itching. Rarely I have seen strep manifest with rash for which you need a culture. Speak to a pediatrician on HealthTap prime or call MD.  
COVID-19 and RAAS No, according to recent statement from American Heart Association, the patients with cardiovascular disease should continue ACEI or ABR as prescribed. WHO also doesn't recommend avoiding ibuprofen for patients with COVID-19 Symptoms, although the use of acetaminophen could be an alternative option. Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
Barrier protection Most of these masks won't completely protect you from a virus, which can penetrate these materials however that does not mean they are not useful. A mask of any sort is good if you are coughing or sneezing to limit some of the aerosols and also is better than nothing if you are out and about in a high risk situation. The chance of you catching the virus is highly dependent on lengthexposure & dos Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
There are many online resources to help you distinguish between the two. But, yes it is a good idea to stay home until told otherwise. Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
Self isolate. avoid contact, wash hands, plenty of rest and fluids, if high fever or trouble t=breathing call doctor they can advise you about testing.  
It could be. self isolate, wash your hands, plenty of fluids and rest, if you get a high fever or have trouble breathing call your doctor.  
Unlikely covid. Unlikely to be corona listening to your symptoms. Stay home and wear masks (anything that covers nose and mouth) proven to decrease transmission by 50%. If you are unwell in terms of respiratory rate (google) >25 or become medically unstable you need to find a corona hospital emergency room. Outside of these conditions stay home and stay safe. The more we all travel in the next 3 days is bad.  
Yes call your doctor for advise. Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
It is possible. You can self quarantin yourself for 2 weeks. If develop and symptoms especially fever and cough get tested. Since you consider yourself a hypocondriac i suggest to wear an N-95 or surgical mask to prevent similar situations. Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
Covid-19 This may be influenza or Covid 19 and warrants a call to your physician to get instructions of whether to be examined,cultured and/or tested for Covid 19 virus, ordered to have a chest xray and/or started, on antibiotics. A lot depends on whether you're in an endemic area or have been exposed to someone who has the infection or had travelled from an affected region. Gargle,avoid dehydration. Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
RHD. If your rheumatic heart disease hasn't caused weakness of the heart muscle or cardiac arrhythmia it shouldn't predispose you to more complications than anyone else in good health. Keep your resistance and immune system high by avoiding fatigue, dehydration, excessive stress, poor nutrition and exposure to ill people. Practice social distancing. At sign of sore throat gargle with warm salt water .  
Possibly. if you had your symptoms for a week and they haven't gotten worse or developed into a fever, you probably do not have COVID-19.IF you are still worried see your PCP.  
Per RSA NICD: Seek care right away if difficulty breathing, other severe symptoms.Seek testing if sick, PLUS known Covid-19 contact, or travel to high risk country, or been in facility treating people with Covid-19, or severe pneumonia of unknown cause.Call 0800 029 999 for test.If sick or possibly exposed (not both), stay home.Seek consultation if sick.If known exposure & not sick, self-isolate 14 days.

COVID-19 infections tend to have cough, whereas strep usually lacks cough but has more throat pain. Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
Coronavirus PUI crit. Self-quarantine and monitor yourself for 14 days from return date.If symptoms develop, Please contact the NICD for screening to see if you have to get tested.Public Hotlines:+27 800029999; +27 800111132; +27 82 883 9920.  
Maybe. Do video w/  
Test Since there is a risk for coronavirus, please stay home, rest and drink fluids. Monitor for symptoms including fever, dry cough and/or shortness of breath. Avoid contact with others and consider testing. The symptoms of COVID 19 may be very mild. Travel is one risk factor for acquiring the disease. Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
Too soon to recover On aveage, viral respiratory illnesses may take 2-3 weeks for full recovery and severe cases may take 4-6 weeks. If your symptoms worsen, you should contact your health care provider to inquire regarding Corona virus testing or quarantine. Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
Viral systemic infec Sounds like it could be systemic infection, like Influenza or Corona viruses. Please contact the NICD for screening to see if you have to get tested.Public Hotline:+27 800029999; +27 800111132; +27 82 883 9920.Only use Paracetamol for pain, if not allergic to it. Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
Get meds refilled. With the COVID-19 pandemic, people with chronic conditions or even intermittent conditions should get their meds refilled in case pharmacy services close down. For asthma patients, they should refill their inhalers. Some use only an urgent "rescue" inhaler like albuterol, while others also use "preventive" inhalers like fluticasone. It's best to keep both on hand. If symptoms go bad, it's ER time.  
Probably... ... but we here on this forum answer general medical questions, not particulars of individual medical coverage. Call Medival aid to know for sure. Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
Flu like symptoms. Stay home for 7 days while you monitor your temperature. COVID 19 is typically associated with dry cough, fever and shortness of breath. Your nasal congestion and muscle aches are more typical of influenza. If you develop a fever or worsening, please arrange testing for both influenza and coronavirus. Drink fluids, rest and avoid contact with others.  
Yes: Not wheezing but difficulty of breathing is a symptom of the corona virus infection but it is not the common one. It can be seen sometimes. The common symptoms are fever and cough mostly dry cough. The wheezing could be due to asthma or allergies in general. Since covid 19 can be seen even without any symptoms i suggest you to get in touch with your doctor for advise and follow up with you. Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
Covid 19 tests You can be tested either at any of the private labs or at selected government clinics. You need to meet the criteria for testing before it is done. Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
Virus. Symptoms could be either influenza or the covid 19 virus. Call your local doctor to discuss these new changes in your health to determine what testing will,be needed, and steps you should take. At least for,now, treat the symptoms with acetaminophen (not ibuprofen) , Cough syrup. Isolate yourself away from other people, wear a mask to avoid spreading virus, sneeze into elbow, wash hands frequently.  
Call a doctor Most places require a doctor to order this, but check into your local healthcare services to see if there is way for you to be tested without that, good luck. There are criteria in most places to qualify for testing, so look into that to see if you qualify, ask your doctor... Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
Anxiety Your anxiety is overall justified, given massive social tension mounted by the pandemic. Depending on local resources and through your doc's office, you may benefit from counseling from a clinical psychologist via telemedicine in order to avoid exposure during lockdown. Use this time to connect to your loved ones remotely ( Skype, phone, etc) and talk about your worries. Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
Urgent Care! You must go to an Urgent Care Center or Emergency Room as soon as possible to have an exam at which time lab tests & a chest X-ray should be ordered to help determine your diagnosis. The sooner you are properly evaluated & treated the better! I wish you well with your health! Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
Good question. Awareness and precautions are important, but your wife plays a valuable role for those who have contracted the disease. She will be at higher risk than the general population and we are seeing HCPs contracting Covid-19. There is no one correct answer to this question because situations vary. Best option is for your wife to discuss this with her employer and take precautions. Good luck!  
Call a doctor You may need a doctor’s order ASAP if you’ve been exposed and are symptomatic, to get tested, so call to get that order, and when you go to get tested, please try to place a mask on your face to protect others if you can Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
COVID-19 criteria Do you have any medical conditions that would put you at high risk? If so, I would book a virtual consult with a dr. If not, we are not currently testing due to lack of capacity if there is no fever, dry cough & shortness of breath with travel history. I would treat for flu and complete 14 days (possibly longer if still sick) quarantine and contact a dr if condition changes Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
Probably not. Fever and cough, headache, body aches are much more common. Please follow your symptoms, treat appropriately. Honey in hot tea, gargle with salt water, suck hard candy. Secrets/cepachol losenges should decrease symptoms. Good luck.  
Viral physiology. HIV is a virus that exists to replicate and increase its numbers, primarily, it’s just how the virus functions, prioritizes replication over other functions. I’m sure there is more complex immunologic answer from a specialist in infectious diseases.  
Covid 19. Dear Patient.What is your concern/ symptoms?Dr Wil.  
Hard to get rid of Molluscum is a virus, the less you touch the lesions the less you will spread the infection. If you want to get rid of it it’s hard, but would suggest a dermatologist rather than the freezing sprays or chemicals used to kill the virus in the skin. There is no ‘limit’ to number of lesions, have not heard that information, but I would not believe that Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
URTI. Dear TeacherACORDING TO YOUR DESCRIPTION, IT CAN BE JUST A VIRAL SORE THROAT. Any fever/headache/dry cough/body pains?Are you improving?Rest, medication like Paracetamol/Antihistamines/lozenges.You are an unlikely contact for Covid 19 at present, but observe, isolate , unless you do not improveRegardsDr Wil.  
Upper Resp Inf. Dear Pretoria patient.You did not mention your daughter's age. It sounds like a viral upper airway infection( anti histamines, paracetamol, Ponstan will suffice for a day)If she gets worse, she can be checked by a doctor.If she was not in contact with a positive patient, no need for testing.Stay home, lots of fluids, rest, meds and observe .Monitor her temp as well.RegardsDr Wil.  
Hi there . Hi there, if there’s any other symptom like fever, shortness of breath you should get tested and seek medical atention however you should call your local emergency line for COVID and stay away from hospitals, and follow OMS guidelines please .  
High temperature COVID stands for 'COrona VIrus Diesase'. We know that high temperature kills most pathogens eg protozoa, viruses and bacteria. That's why cooking is recommending for certain foods rather than eating it 'raw'. Temperatures of 140 to 160 degree F kills most pathogens including viruses. Corona viruses are sensitive to heat and cooking will destroy the outer protein layer and kill the virus. Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
Infection. seem you have an infectious gastroenteritis, flu or even coronavirus. Take tylenol, stay hydrated, get tests ordered by a physician. .  
Be very cautious . There is not a lot of information on children with COVID-19 but definitely would try to protect this child especially and consult the doctor ASAP if child develops fever and shortness of breath.  
Symptoms The symptom of COVID-19 begins with mild flu-like symptoms such as fatigue, sore throat and sneeze, followed by fever, dry cough. In severe cases, the cough can progress to productive cough, persistent and followed by shortness of breath. Some patients may also experience GI symptoms such as nausea vomiting and diarrhea. Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
Cough of COVID-19 In COVID-19, cough is usually dry, persistent (initially not much different from a cold), then turns into wet with mucus and high fever (pneumonia). In severe cases, severe shortness of breath and oxygen desaturation can develop after the pneumonia (severe respiratory distress syndrome). Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
Not particularly. The facts are your nose & upper airway add humidity to the air you breathe to the point it reaches ~100% at the level of air exchange. Vaporizers help loosen thicker mucus in the upper airways so you can cough it up, but it would not have any effect on the deep airways or any germs that reach them. .  
Systemic infection Fever and muscle pains could indicate systemic infection, likely viral, deoendiing on your travel history. Right hand joint pains, if previously injured or arthritic, could be flared up by systemic infection.Call your local Nurse or Doctor to get screened telephonically for Influenza & Corona viruses & Malaria.Colchicine and Panado may help if gouty joint pains. Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
Viral syndrome You're symptoms are likely viral syndrome; could be the flu, however, given the current COVID outbreak, it may very well be corona virus. Please follow CDC guidelines for self quarantine. Wash your hands frequently with soap and water. Keep hydrated. Take tylenol for fever/pain. Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
Likely nerve pain this diagnosis would require a visit and imaging but the most likely cause is either pressure on a nerve in your neck or referred pain from the neck and shoulder with symptoms felt at the shoulder/shoulder blade. Try to use the chlorzoxazone or an NSAID (ibuprofen or naproxen) or a combo of both and also try ice for pain, heat for stiffness or spasms. It doesn't sound at all like COVID-19. Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
Consult first BEtter to consult either telephonically or virtually. Lancet and ampath are doing tests. Discovery will pay if it is positive. Gift of the givers are also doing drive through testing for R750.00 - at least in pietermaritzburg. Discovery have a covid fund. Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
Isolation. . The virus is spread by respiratory route, it can live on surfaces for up,to 72 hours. SO:Social isolation (keep 6 feet from others)Wear disposable,gloves when coming in contact with surfaces outside your home for several weeksStay healthy, eat right, get exercise, proper sleepDiscuss your fears with others to get a realistic view of this illness and it’s risks.Don’t panic..  
Uncertain. The exact amount of time would depend on the inoculum or how much virus was deposited and whether the cash were dry or moist . The limited studies suggest that the virus does not live very long on cardboard - about 4 hrs or so, so I suspect paper may be similar. If it were moist or wet, it may last longer. Heat may inactivate the virus, so consider setting the money in the sun or put in a drier.  
Um, no Inhaling Lysol can be deleterious to your health, more than COVID-19 itself. Burning your pulmonary tissues may actually make you more susceptible to getting sick from the virus. Be rational. Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
Great Question Not sure if you need to worry about your shoes, but it won't hurt. In my house, we take off shoes and outside clothes at the door after we enter. The clothes go immediately into the laundry, we wash our hands with soap and water, then put on "house clothes". Different from "public" clothes. We try to prevent the potential introduction of the virus into out home. Once inside, everything is clean. Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
Yes, but... Bacteria are living creatures, like the rest of us. Viruses are missing some parts so are not living unless they are inside another living creature. Viruses that are by themselves are dormant like seeds or spores, waiting to be reactivated. In a general sense, it is fine to think of viruses as living things, but technically speaking, they are not independently living when alone.  
Gargling. You can't be sure but it may help if you do those things as well as using zinc lozenges at the first sign of any throat discomfort and stay hydrated also. I recommend them. At least it'll do no harm.  
Contact doctor. Was he/she exposed to coronavirus or flu or other illness?He/she may need to be examined and/or tested. Please call his/her doctor to discuss and possibly be examined for proper diagnosis and treatment.  
Antibiotic I don't recommend antibiotics for a simple viral upper respiratory tract infection unless examination revealed signs of acute bronchitis or sinusitis. They are not effective for viral infections like coVid 19 with no bacterial lung involvement either. If you've been exposed to someone with coVid 19 or or if you or someone you were exposed to travelled to a region where it was endemic, get tested Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
Exam needed. You are assuming that the discomfort is coming from both lungs, but pain of pleurisy or pneumonia wouldn't come and go In different sites. I doubt your symptoms are lung related, but fever, chills, sweats, worse cough, shortness of breath, wheezing, warrant testing.. If you've been exposed to someone with covid, or if you or someone you were exposed to travelled to an affected region, get tested.  
Self Quarantine . Suggest Self Quarantine for 14 days . If symptomatic , contact your Primary Care Physician or use this platform.  
Socially isolate. get pleanty of fluids and rest and avoid others call dr if fever or difficulty breathing.  
Question You have not posted a question. Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
Diabetes. My answer would be controlled or not. Type 1 or 2 if managed well and treated can still maintain good immunity. If either are out of control then infections of any type more likely. .  
Per RSA NICD: Self-isolate for 14 days.Seek testing if sick.Call 0800 029 999 for test information.Seek consultation if sick, preferably by phone or telemedicine.Seek care right away if difficulty breathing, other severe symptoms.Good luck, from the United States!  
Incubation period 2-14 days(time from exposure to time of getting illness). I am unclear if the doctor is positive or your husband is?You should isolate yourselves at home for 14 days.If your husband is positive,he should be in his own room and own bathroom,if possible.Testing only recommended if there are symptoms(fever or cough or shortness of breath)and then you should be tested.Good hand washing/no touching face Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
Monitor temp. Most cases of COVID-19 are associated with symptoms, but not all. Your symptoms may be related to coronavirus infection or another infection. I would recommend that you be tested for Coronavirus and then stay inside, avoiding contact with others while awaiting your test results. Use good hand washing, disinfect surfaces and drink fluids.  
Eyes, nose, mouth. Not ears. See https://www.healthtap.com/blog/covid-19-care-guidelines  
Cluster cases I would recommend staying at home, rest, drink fluids and monitoring your temperature. You may have COVID-19 or another illness. If you are otherwise healthy, await test results. Keep utensils, linens separate and washed. Use good hand washing and disinfect surfaces. If the test is positive, please have screening of all family members in your home. Avoid contact with others. Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
No we have no evidence of any concern with such spread. It may be worth wiping all packages that come i nto the house with lysol wipes Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
Immunocompromised body is busy dealing with diabetes, not as much resiliancy remaining to fight viral symptoms, and subsequent opportunistic infections Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
Possible virus. This is likely a viral infection. If you have a fever and/or the cough or sore throat get worse, you should be examined by your doctor. If you've been exposed to a particular illness, such as strep or the flu or coronavirus, you may need to be tested.For now, rest, drink fluids, take acetaminophen or ibuprofen as needed if you have no medical contraindication.  
Several days Lysol should be good. https://www.healthtap.com/blog/covid-19-care-guidelines Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
Coronavirus lives New coronavirus may live on surfaces for a few hours or a few days depending on the type of surface, temperature or humidity. One report indicated that new coronavirus can survive on hard surfaces for up to 72 hours and on cardboard for up to 24 hours. Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
It depends. If the visited place has a high rate of coronavirus infections to take some precautions is important such as if you develop fever or cough or any other coronavirus infection symptoms. To be tested is desired but will you be able to get tested? In some places testing kits are reserved to very sick and hospitalized patient. Self quarantine in cooperation with your doctor is the way to go. Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
Screening test if. If you develop symptoms of dry cough, fever and/or shortness of breath, consider re testing since the test may convert to a positive test if infected. Other causes should be considered including an allergic reaction. Try one dose of an antihistamine and gauge improvement. Stay at home for three days if there is no fever. .  
Coronavirus. Yes, according to previous knowledge, most virus including coronavirus likely will not survive hotter climates. I would expect or hope this will die down in summer time. Nevertheless, this is new coronavirus, let's wait and see. I also think that with strong human intervention, the virus may reduce or be eliminated before summer. Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
Coronavirus and ACEI. Recent publications including the one from the lancet showed COVID-19 binds to ACE-2 receptor on target cells for entrance. The expression of ACE-2 receptor is substantially increased in patients with diabetes who were treated with ACE inhibitors or ARB. NSAIDS has the similar effect. All medications can have some unexpected side effects. Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
Yes I would advise screening due to your exposure. Fever is very commonly associated with COVID-19. Stay at home, rest, drink fluids and monitor your temperature. Arrange the testing which also may include a chest image with your PCP. Since your have been traveling, a pulmonary embolism is another possible cause of your shortness of breath. Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
COVID19 even though your have no fever or shortness of breath, your travel history fits criteria to be tested. I suggest you get tested for COVID19 - speak with your GP to advise further, self isolate in the meanwhile Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
Shortness of breath. Covid testing is hard to come by. At 37 you are in a lower risk group. And I doubt you could get a test. Keep isolated for two weeks. I know we have been ordering tests through HealthTap, but that does not lead to getting the test done, due to shortages. (3/21/20)  
Basically the HPV virus is transferred within fluids generated during intercourse. A mechanical skin contact appears to be part of the process but defining the exact amount of contact required is difficult. The genital strains of HPV are specific to those locations. There are other HPV strains that cause things like skin warts but these are different. Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
Observatn is enough. By looking at your child you'll know if he is having breathing difficulties. Cough with a runny nose is common in children. You should be concerned only if he is refusing to play and eat, or if he develops breathing difficulties. Having a fever doesn't mean he has the Coronavirus. He is more likely to be infected with any of the common infections in your area of Gauteng. Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
Per RSA NICD: Seek care right away if difficulty breathing, other severe symptoms. Seek testing if sick, PLUS known COVID-19 contact, or travel to high risk country, or been in facility treating people with COVID-19, or severe pneumonia of unknown cause.Call 0800 029 999 for test. If sick or possibly exposed (not both), stay home.Seek consultation if sick.If known exposure & not sick, self-isolate 14 days. Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
Coronavirus. Stay calm. Most people with coronavirus infection only get mild respiratory symptoms, especially among younger patients. Diabetes and use of ACEI or ARB may increase your risk of infection. Practicing common sense of prevention is critical during this outbreak crisis. Avoid risk exposure, wash hand, wear mask as needed. Get tested if you develop symptoms. Effect drugs are coming. .  
Fever? Start by call Pediatrician ASAP. if high fe ver or projectie vomiting take to ER . take to ER if inconsolable and cannot get pedicatrician IF mild respiratory or GI symptoms likely virus and want to make sure adequately hydrated and may just watch, isolate from contact , and give chicken soup . work on soothing and disstraction Keep in touch with pediatrician.

Can talk with doctor Doctors can give you the up-to-date information. Video consultations available (start over and click on Talk-to-Doctor). We have informational posts on our Healthtap.com/blog. As the US president has given mistaken information at various times during this pandemic, be sure to check with doctors and the CDC website. People usually should not be tested without symptoms or direct exposure. (3/21/20) Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
Stay home. Family members should stay home and avoid contact with your brother. Keep linens, bath area and utensils separated. He should monitor his temperature, drink fluids, rest and your family should be screened for Coronavirus.  
Probably. We should all be cautious , not worried about Covid-19. It is prudent for us all to be socially isolating, washing our hands, supplementing with vits. D and C and working on making the best of it. BE grateful for the things that are going well in your life, reach out with verbal and video support for ALL the loved ones and even people you just know are isolated with support. Don't bother to worry.

Source of bleeding There are many causes of the small amount of blood in your sputum. You may have a nasal or upper airway source. Strep infection, influenza are possible causes. COVID-19 typically is associated with fever, dry cough and/or shortness of breath.. Please contact your PCP for an evaluation, possible chest image and evaluation of the source of the bleeding. Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
Many causes. Most cases of COVID-19 with symptoms are associated with fever, however milder cases do occur. Your shortness of breath and difficulty breathing may have a number of causes and should be evaluated. Please call your PCP. Avoid dust, mold, smoke, animal dander, pollen. Your symptoms also are consistent with an allergic reaction. Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
Flu like sx. Stay at home, monitor your temperature, drink fluids and rest. If your cough is associated with fever and/or does not begin to improve, please see your PCP. You may have bacterial bronchitis -avoid smoke, dust, mold, animal dander and pollen. Influenza and COVID are associated with fever. The cough with COVID is typically dry. If you have underlying lung disease, test for CoV/flu. Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
Bacterial likely. Use nasal saline rinses, a nasal steroid and discuss the use of Augmentin for 10 days with your PCP. It is more likely that you have a bacterial infection. An examination of your mouth or uploaded photo to a HT virtual consultation is important. Avoid smoke and if you are a smoker, please consider a biopsy of the area. .  
Simple Cold but..... Sounds like simple Cold, But under the current health challenges of the world, it's best to be preemptive. And because Covid-19 is an infectious disease mostly transmitted through respiratory fluid droplets, One should first follow the WHO/CDC current guidelines on hygiene. Then gargle with salt-water or vinegar-water after each meal/bedtime plus take Aleve or Ibuprofen for soreness/fever... .  
Coronavirus testing. Yes, get tested if symptomatic (early symptoms could be mild respiratory symptoms and nonspecific) or self quarantine given your high risk of exposure. .  
Maybe. Has she been around anyone who has tested positive for COVID-19? Is she having shortness of breath or labored breathing? If so, then, yes, consider getting her tested. If not, it is more likely that she has the flu or some other virus. If it seems like more than just a regular cold, reach out to her pediatrician for more advice.  
Monitor. Stay at home, monitor your temperature, drink fluids and rest. Nasal congestion and post nasal drip is not typically associated with COVID-19. Watch for dry cough, fever and if your shortness of breath does not resolve, discuss whether you need an inhaler, chest physiotherapy and/or testing. If you have a trach, watch for signs of infection such as more secretions or a change in color . Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
Stay home. Stay at home, rest, drink fluids and monitor your temperature. Your symptoms are more consistent with a cold or sinus infection. Nasal saline and a decongestant may be helpful. If you develop COVID symptoms including dry cough, fever, and/or shortness of breath, testing is indicated. Report fever and shortness of breath to your PCP.  
If you get fever yes. but from what we know it may bee a little late to get the chines virus after so many days. Monitor tempreture.  
Avoid cold/ice... Though untreated WPW Syndrome can be regarded as pre-existing chronic condition, there is no current evidence that one is more susceptible to Covid-19, an infectious disease mostly transmitted through Respiratory Fluid Droplets. Best to follow WHO/CDC guideline on hygiene. Plus avoid cold/ice drinks/foods. Drink warm water/tea, even chicken soup. Aleve or ibuprofen can be helpful for fever/soreness.  
Real vs. textbook. Real-life criteria is different because we don't have enough tests, supplies, or medical staff around the world at this time (March 2020). Textbook criteria are suspected COVID in hospitalized persons or in those with underlying medical conditions; or persons who got symptoms less than 14 days after (1) contact with a suspect or confirmed COVID patient or (2) travel through high-risk COVID area.  
Screen sputum. You may have a bacterial illness such as bronchitis, pneumonia or a sinus infection. Your PCP may collect sputum, screen for Strep/influenza. COVID-19 is usually associated with a dry cough, but secondary infection may occur. Please see your PCP.  
Likely a virus. What you describe is likely caused by a virus, antibiotics don't do anything against viruses. Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
Many possibilities. Most people get a headache at some time, such as from colds, infections (usually viruses or sinusitis), lack of sleep, too much driving, long hours on the computer, stress at work, etc. .. A bad or severe headache, increasing headache, recurrent headache, weird headache, or one with other worrisome symptoms should be checked by one's primary care doctor or the ER. Can call one's Dr. first to chat. Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
Washing clothes. Although so far it has not been shown to live on surfaces like clothes for as long as it lives on surfaces like plastic and metal, it is definitely good hygienic practice to wash your clothes in the hottest water the garment allows. Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
Covid. For most people the infection can last up to two weeks. In people who get particularly ill the infection last 4 to 6 weeks. .  
Check with PCP. Data emerging from preliminary studies in France suggest a decades old medicine, chloroquine may be useful as a preventative drug. It has been used to prevent malaria for decades & manufactures in the US have announced they are increasing production to meet an expected demand. Your status & what they are doing in your country should be answered by your doc. Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
May confirm with  
During this pandemic. Throat pain can be from a strep throat infection (antibiotics needed), a cold or influenza or other virus, or from some other cause such as allergies or irritants. Usually, a person sees the doctor (call first) if the sore throat is bothersome, recurrent, or doesn't go away quickly. COVID-19 infections tend to have cough, whereas strep throat usually lacks cough but has more throat pain. (3/21/20)  
Testing. People are still getting other illnesses than COVID. Given no cough or shortness of breath, other than watchful waiting COVID should pass in a week or two. Strep, influenza still possible. This testing can be done through your own provider. You can also get your own strep test at pharmacy or many can swab you there. Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
Phone triage. Call your GP's office for instructions and identify local resources. Your symptoms are suggesting sinusitis (other causes still possible) that is frequently viral and self limited. Local regulations should also be followed in such circumstances. Self quarantine will work for all in trying to prevent the spread. Hydration and rest will also work regardless of what the cause for your symptoms is. Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
COVID Good guidelines can be found at cdc. gov/coronavirus/2019. You would be considered low risk. Symptoms last up to two weeks. High probability many will get the disease and testing leads to no change in action at this time. No obvious therapy (however some encouraging possibilites) and for most people the virus runs its course without incidence. Stay put and talk to your provider. Would you like to video or text chat with me?  
Yes, Maybe, Maybe. We presume one is immune to a respiratory virus for a while after getting the infection (that's the way it is with other viruses). A few people have trouble with their antibodies and don't have much immunity. Shedding of viruses sometimes is longer than 14 days. In life, there will always be some people who get reinfected, for whatever reason. Usually one is immune after the infection. (3/21/20)  
Coronavirus, COVID-19 has high affinity to the lung, causing viral pneumonia. Fortunately, most people get only mild respiratory symptoms. Those who have high risks (age over 65, chronic diseases) tend to get pneumonia and complications. The most important way to prevent the complications is not to get infection, practice common sense of prevention. If you catch the infection, start early treatment.
