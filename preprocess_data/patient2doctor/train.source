Hello doctor, I get a cough for the last few days, which is heavy during night times. No raise in temperature but feeling tired with no travel history. No contact with any Covid-19 persons. It has been four to five days and has drunk a lot of Benadryl and took Paracetamol too. Doctors have shut the OP so do not know what to do? Please help. 
Thank you doctor, I have phlegm but not a lot. A tiny amount comes out most of the time. I have no difficulty in breathing. No medical conditions and not a smoker nor a drinker. 
Hello doctor, I am suffering from coughing, throat infection from last week. At that time fever did not persist and also did not felt any chest pain. Two days later, I consulted with a doctor. He prescribed Cavidur 625, Montek LC, Ambrolite syrup and Betaline gargle solution. Since then throat infection improved and frequent cough also coming out. Coughing also improved remarkably though not completely. From yesterday onwards fever is occuring (maximum 100-degree Celcius). I have not come in touch with any foreign returned person nor went outside. In our state, there is no incidence of Covid-19. Please suggest what to do? 
Thank you doctor, After doing all these I can upload all for further query. 
Thank you doctor, As per your guidelines, I have made one test. Due to city shutdown, I could not able to make an x-ray of chest. Fever is coming every 12 hours. But cough does not persist currently. The only problem is a fever. I am uploading the blood examination report. Please advice. 
Thank you doctor, How many tablets of Azithromycin to be taken? Is it in the morning? I want to make you know that I have already taken Azithromycin five days before. Should she start it? And also can I start an Iron tablet today itself? 
Hello doctor, I am a 23-year-old man. I have anxiety and depression but no immunodeficiency disorders or chronic diseases. First, I wanna know if my immune system is weakened and how likely am I to die of Coronavirus. Second, I have itchiness in my throat and shortness of breath. I always have it because of anxiety but now it is more persistent than before. I also feel a very subtle feeling of pain, burning sensation and itchiness in my chest. I did not go out during the past ten days and have not been in contact with someone with positive Covid. And I quit smoking past week. Down to one or zero cigarettes from 20 a day. Why am I feeling itchiness and pain and burning sensation? How likely am I to have Covid-19? And how likely am I to die from it? 
Hello doctor, Last night I was getting chills, feeling more cold than usual and lightheaded and a lot of burping. Maybe like every 30 minutes or less or so feel more chills running down my body and chest feeling bit weird like I am starting having trouble breathing then goes back to normal and repeats, with weird feeling like chills down my left and right lungs or left and right upper chest. Also, my heart was pumping fast. Also, some minor coughs were there since seven days ago, still here. I have white mucus and have not gotten yellow yet. I took medicines yesterday but today I got severe cold and flu medicine with a pain reliever, the chills did not go away. Then today, I called the doctor on the phone and told him what happen last night and the same thing happened this morning too. I had minor coughs, feeling lightheaded, feel like maybe cannot breathe or something, and a lot of burping. I told him the burping issue was going on for at least two years, but somehow this time I am feeling lightheaded. He just gives Pepcid, a try maybe GERD. I ate that today still feeling chills now and still burping a lot. Right now, still some chills on arms, with breathing issue or something makes my chest feel weird and arm sometimes. So, should I be worried? I do not think I have a fever now but do not feel hot on the forehead? Was it GERD or flu, it is Coronavirus or something else? I hope it is not Coronavirus. I am 21 years old and weigh around 110-115 kg. 
Thank you doctor, I travel to school, nearby grocery stores in the bus. No airport exposure. I have not checked the temperature. I do not feel hot or anything. I have minor coughs and sore throat. Yes, I have mucus which seems white or clear for now. During sleep, I do not have much aches. Last night I have not got much sleep, probably because I was thinking about stuff being worried, but got some sleep though. 
Thank you doctor, I woke up this morning, I had trouble sleeping being worried, but I got some sleep then nearby phone ringing woke me up. So far, seems no one got any severe coughs or pain so far. I only hear minor coughs the past week or so. Thanks for those medicine recommendations for sleep. I fall asleep quicker, usually, it takes me around one hour to fall asleep on most days. I will try to avoid smoking as much as possible. Yes, I will be staying inside since many places are on lockdown. And school is online. I recently turned on the air purifier to clean up some air for allergies possible viruses but makes me cold. I might not need AC unless really hot. I will be staying home for the next month at least. My chills right now are feeling a bit better, but a little sick only because maybe I did not get enough sleep. I stay in San Francisco CA, United States, and there are close to 40 confirmed cases around here. No severe reports near my district, and have not heard anyone in serious condition. So, last week I have a sore throat and tonsil pain while swallowing for a few days, then one day drank a lot of honey and water and some tea, then it got better. Not sure if it got smaller, but the pain was less now though. Between my tonsils in the middle (behind the tongue) looks like my throat, got some red stuff, maybe looks like inflamed or rashes. Any recommendations? Any foods or drinks that can help? 
Thank you doctor, As of now 12:40 PM I am breathing harder than usual since 30 minutes ago. I only ate some breakfast and drank water. Here is my story: Before Feb 28th - no issues at all, besides always burping a lot, sometimes bloating, no coughs, tonsil was enlarged for a while, no lightheadedness, no breathing problems, not sick. Friday February 28th - I woke up feeling unwell, drank water went back to bed, came back out super lightheaded about to faint, lied on bed for an hour, came out stomach feeling weird, even more lightheaded about to faint, can barely even eat a little noodles and two small pieces of spam, vomited it, then four more times which as water or acid. Hours later was better. Saturday February 29th - diarrhea Sunday March 1st - diarrhea Monday March 2 - diarrhea Tuesday March 3 - diarrhea Wednesday March 4 - No stool Thursday March 3 - No more diarrhea Friday March 4th - Monday March 9th - no issues Monday March 9th - feeling better, no problems, enlarged tonsil, no coughs really. Sunday march 15 - no problems besides burping, minor coughs, some sore throat Afternoon I ate chicken, burping a lot, stomach uncomfortable, felt like breathing problems, chills on hands, chest and left and right side, felt like could not breathe. 20 minutes later, still chills breathing a bit better, lightheaded kind of feel like fainting, then went to bed for 15 minutes (the breathing problem and weird chest feeling comes back randomly), ate tums, then later I drank cough and flu medicine. On Monday march 16 - woke up around 11:30 AM, feeling breathing problems, chills around body, lightheaded again, chest feeling weird, burping a lot, and I described my story to doctor he said it sounds like you ate something bad, does sound like GERD, of course we do not know for sure unless lab tests maybe on stool. He asked have you tried stronger antacids like Pepcid or Zantac? I said no. Then doctor asked me to try Pepcid and tell me how it goes. Tuesday and Wednesday March 16/17 - feeling better, no lightheadedness, no more chills, minor coughs, sore throat, burping a lot, no breathing problems so far. Pepcid no problems so far besides making me burp almost all day. Wednesday night still coughing a lot and drank severe cold and flu medicine. Thursday march 21 I woke up fine, then once ate Pepcid and drank some water, heart rate was going really fast, started to make worried, called doctor office they said can you count your beats per minute, then I counted, my phone was showing my heart rating going to 120 bpm, when I counted to them was not 120 bpm, then they told me to call back if it gets worse. Then shortly after, I drank some water and ate a little bit of breakfast. My heart rate started to drop slowly and was getting better after that. Friday march 20- 10 AM I woke up with some chest pains (chest area above the stomach), then some coughing and feeling a little sick, little lightheaded, heart beating fast, breathing harder, felt of shortness of breath. Drank some water and breathe harder, a little bit of mucus. 15-20 minutes later no more chest pains, still breathing harder. 11 AM - still breathing a little bit harder than usual, coughing would make me breathe even harder. Better now, but still breathing a little harder than usual. 11:30 AM moving makes me breathe harder, sat in bed. 11:58 AM - feeling a bit better 12:10 - feeling like breathing a harder than usual. After an hour later, feeling better now which is strange. Not sure if its heart problems, acid reflux, chest issues, or esophagus. 
Thank you doctor, I went to the store to look for Zantac they did not have it, so I talked to the pharmacy they said sounds like could be some weird chest tightening and the doctor said since Pepcid and Zantac are the same. He said to try Ranitidine. Right now I tried Pepcid again like now, for the first five to ten minutes I think it means me feel more nervous or anxiety or something, I tried to calm myself by putting fingers on teeth. Then I think now it did not cause my heart to beat super fast this time which was strange. Even water makes my heart beat a little faster. Should I stick with Pepcid? Finish the entire bottle? I think it has 20-30 pieces. I used to lie down after a meal a few years ago like I get hungry before I go to bed then I started eating snacks and lying down. Sometimes I starve myself. Sometimes I wake up with acid feeling in my mouth. I don't know why I woke up this morning with chest pain, like the middle area right above the stomach and felt like I had breathing problems, breathing harder than usual, drank water and barely could eat breakfast (lasted for at least 30 minutes+). I then waited a bit after 10 minutes, drank hot water and ate breakfast, I started to breathe better again. Could it be shortness or breath? May be blood pressure? Esophagus issue? Chest issue? Heart issue? I am having weird breathing. Should I be worried? 
Thank you doctor, I was trying to finish the bowl of food in one hour. I was eating veggies and rice, halfway through felt something like acid may be some pain in chest and throat. Feeling lightheaded so ate some meat to then coughed after. 
Thank you doctor, I really appreciate your help so much. I appreciate your time and effort to help me and give advice. Only thing I am worried is just the chest pains, breathing issues and esophagus and throat stuff. I will try to wait two to three hours after eating or drinking before bed now. I hope to get less chest issues when I wake up. 
Yeah if it doesn't get better Laryngoscopy would be perfect. Okay, I'll give it some time Thank you! I try to eat vegetables and fruits. I don't eat much junk food that much. I used to eat more junk years ago, but now mostly vegetables, fruits, meat (pork, chicken, beef, fish) usually not fried, and tried to eat whole wheat bread with fried chicken patty from the super market (for school lunch) since its cheap and its chicken (stopped now after acid problems), don't really eat french fries, pizza or drink soda etc... Exercise, haven't been exercising these few months. I have been telling myself that, but then i haven't really been doing it. Used to a lot years ago, now barely. Since high school, when i exercise running when i try to get air feels like throat is tight or chest is tight and air is trying to squeeze its way through. After this point High school until college feels like i'm not breathing enough air. When i was younger (Elementary/middle school) felt like i gotten a lot more air then now through my throat and air doesn't squeezes through. One doctor just used stethoscope for heart and lungs, told me to breathe hasn't said much about it. Then another doctor said, sounds you are not breathing that much, feels like not getting another air (in high school, like 4-6 years ago maybe), they didn't do much about it. So, when i try to breath regularly, seems like not much air comes out through mouth even before acid reflux,.That's why recent breathing problems kinda worry me, but anyways yeah like that. 
Sounds good! Awesome! Appreciate your time and effort to help, this means a lot. Very patient and kind!

Hi, I m a 55 yr old white female, 5`4 , 180 lbs. I had childhood asthma and bronchitis, and were given steroids frequently. I seemed to grow out of it at age 17. During the last 14 yrs I ve developed Fibromyalgia/Chronic Fatigue, RA, for 14 months my SED rate stayed at 53-108 and they could not find out why, Cushing s Syndrome, neuropathy of the feet, and most importantly - Hypogammagobulinemia. I rec d IGG iv s monthly for 4 yrs, then lost insurance 6 yrs. ago. I m disabled and on Medicare, I haven t rec d IV s in 6 yrs. During that time I ve had pneumonia 17 times, once was septic pneumonia, constant sinus problems, PCP infection and a rare form of arthritis associated with the hypo (the Dr. couldn t tell me the name of it). I have contacted Medicare, foundations and pharm companies trying to get help to start treatment again. Reaching out to any possible help has been met with apathy and no one would try to point me in the right direction. I m really worried and would like to know my chances of surviving if I can t get the IGG treatments. Thank you very much for your time. 
The reading of my chest x-ray states that there are hazed and confluent densities seen in the left upper lung field. The rest of the lungs are clear. The heart is not enlarged. The rest of the included structures are unremarkable. I am very much worried because the impression states that I have MINIMAL PTB, LEFT WITH PNEUMONIA. Please advice me on what to do best as I fear this might affect my application for renewal of contract.

I was given amoxycillin for a chest infection and did not improve after 48 hours, therefore I went back to the GP who then gave me Clarythmomycin as it resulted in pneumonia. I have been off work for 3 weeks now and feel completely washed out and exhausted. I had a chest x-ray which was clear, but was given an inhaler temporarily as I was out of breath and wheezy. I still have an incredible amount of phlegm which has now changed from brown to sometimes green to clear. Unfortunately, for last 3 days, my trachea is extremely bruised to touch and feel as if someone is pressing my windpipe. Although my tonsils aren t swollen, my ear hurts deep inside. I have had to start taking paracetamol again this week as feel weak, wobbly and feel as if I am going backwards again instead of improving. I am 45 years old. Non-smoker.This is the 3rd time I have had pneumonia in 18 years. I am reasonably fit and healthy, and I don t suffer from colds normally, but whenever I come down with something, I seem to suffer with it. How long does it take to get back to normal? Are the trachea symptoms part of the initial pneumonia symptoms or would I need to see the GP again. I am feeling extremely fed up of generally feeling unwell. I am taking a tonic (Metatone) and drinking and eating healthily. Basically, is it normal to feel this unwell for so long. 
I was diagnosed with pneumonia and pleurisy Friday 6/22/18.  Dr gave me Azithromiacin and 800mg of ibuprofen .  That was 4 days ago.  Azithromiacin has one pill left, and i no longer take the ibuprofen as not needed.  To date, I take Sudafed PE and Robitussin DM with expectorant & suppressant.  Every 4 hours when the meds wear off, my fever returns with body aches, chills, headache, and coughing. I continually cough up flem, and when lying down need to clear my throat every 30 seconds. I'm also bloated and get air bubbles under my ribs that are painful. 
I ve had symptoms of cough, headache, stuffy nose, fatigue, and sore throat for 4 days. I know these are typical of common cold. However, once before (18 months ago), when I just tried to ride it out, I developed pneumonia and was in hospital for several days. Are there any precautions I can take now to prevent this from getting complicated? Thanks. 
My sister, age 72, and living alone drove herself to an emergency room at 4:00 a.m. with temperature of 101+, chills and a little dizziness. They diagnosed her with pneumonia. She has COPD and uses inhalers and oral meds. I am concerned because she just told me she is extremely tired and has been under a lot of stress due to move from home of 45+ years, family concerns and loss of husband 2 years ago. She had hip replacement three months ago. I live an hour and a half away and am wondering if I should drive to her city and check on her. She does have a son and a neighbor friend looking in on her. 
What is a right central pneumonia? My diagnostic x-ray report states there are hazy densities in the right perihilar and paracardiac areas; trachea is midline; cardiac sillhouette is not enlarged; hemidiaphragms, costophrenic, sulci and bony thoracic cage are unremarkable. I don t understand it. 
Hi, My uncle has been diagnosed with liver cancer and he is in the last stage. After the first chemotherapy he has been admitted to hospital due to pneumonia. Is he again diagnosed with lung cancer? And what are the chances of getting cure? What treatment you would like us to get it done. 
I have been on methadone for approx. 5 years now at a dose of 30mg taken 4 times daily. This has not only stopped any unpleasant withdrawl symptoms but has also offered considerable relief in easing chronic pain from a severe back injury 11 years ago. For the first 3 years of taking the medication I found that while it was effective in these areas their was an exceptional side effect in that it absolutely obliterated any interest in sex or even the ability to physically have sex. Also I found that I had next to no energy, making many things I used to enjoy fall by the wayside which in turn led to severe depression. After extensive talks with my Doctor I was sent for blood analysis and it was found that my level of testosterone was so low it barely registered. I was then put on a 3 week cycle of injections of 2mls of Delatestryl and for the past several years I have been the person that I used to be (it gave me my life back). Know I have been given a new Doctor at the clinic I attend and he has informed me that he is only there to prescribe methadone and will not be responsible for any other prescriptions. I do not have a family doctor and our emerg has said that this falls outside their domain. The walk in clinic treats every individual that I know so badly that their is no doubt in my mind that they will refuse to continue this presciption. (to give you some perspective on our walk in clinic - I went their several mnths back with sever pneumonia and the Doctor looked at my chart once and told me that I would get know %$# narcotics from him and to leave immediately) Any suggestions on how to get across to my knew methadone Doctor (who has only been in prescribing methadone for 2 months) just how much this would severely negatively impact my life? 
My daughter is 11 years old she has has pneumonia she has been sick since January 3rd symptoms keep changing. she is up at night itching all over her upper torso, head, and ears. She has major headache and abdominal pain.. she is very upset and crying because this is going on way to long and she has seen many doctors with no relief any suggestions. Tried most itching products what could be causing the head pain and stomach pain. they check her today for appendicitis 
I was given a steroid shot at 10am this morning when it was discovered that I have potential pneumonia. I was also proscribed an inhaler and a strong antibiotic, both of which I am now actively taking as directed. The Dr offered a cough syrup with codeine for assistance with sleeping through the symptoms that have been interfering with my ability to sleep, which I declined due to being someone who never takes medications at all and fear of having so much in my system at once. The Dr. clarified that Nyquil would be just fine if needed and if I m more comfortable with. I m having some anticipated potential insomnia from the steroid, and some heart palpitations, and I have an irregular heart palpitations to begin with. I feel inclined to take the Nyquil to ensure I get desperately needed sleep, but am concerned with all that is on board, etc. Definitive guidance would be so greatly appreciated, thank you in advance!

My dr. Did a routine CNBC last week. His nurse called and my blood showed signs of anemia. Ok today his nurse called and the blood they deeper searched on showed: the disease of chronic pneumonia?

No cure for mom. Question: the told me Boop was not genetically transferred. This is exactly how my moms lung diseases started. is thimy lung disease genetic? Is it curable? Help please 
My 3 year old son is complaint of stomach pain he also has fever and 1 week before he was diagnosed with pneumonia.he was on amoxicillin.he just finished his antibiotics yesterday and this morning he has fever stomach pain increased heart rate what is causing it 
I am positive for Alpha 1 but at this point am not being treated. I developed bilateral pneumonia 4 weeks ago, have been on two rounds of Levaquin, and other than my fever leaving (which was 102 for three days) don t feel any better. My ribs feel like someone punched me, and whenever I cough, I taste copper which I am assuming is blood. It s probably from how hard I cough,. Been to the doc twice, this time added mucinex to the mix to try to loosen things up. Not sure how much longer I can do this! YYYY@YYYY 
My mother was admitted to St. Jude s last Wednesday with pneumonia. She is 82 and also has COPD and Parkinson s. She was treated with antibiotics and released four days later. She is to continue with antibiotics treatment at her skilled nursing facility for another 7 days. The day after she returned to her skilled nursing facility, she was given a new roommate who has advanced pneumonia and in critical condition. A few days earlier, the doctor at the hospital said that my mother s pneumonia was negative and she was taken out of isolation. Is it dangerous for my mother, who seems to be recovering or has recovered from her pneumonia, to be placed in the same room as a patient with advanced pneumonia? 
My daughter has been sick with the flu for over a week and now has Strep throat and pneumonia. She s saw her doctor, ran some tests and her white blood cell count keeps dropping.

I have been using CPAP machine for a year on pressure 6 with a nasal pillow mask.  I have never had pneumonia in my life.  I am 52 years old and just got my first case of pneumonia (discovered by a CAT scan).  Could the CPAP machine be responsible for causing my pneumonia.  They also found a small 3mm nodule. 
I am a 76 year old female non smoker and non drinker I drink 1 cup of decaf a day . in the past year I have had 3 or 4 bouts of pneumonia one was infiltrated just got bronchitis I have have been treated with Z pack and amoxicillin to taking blood thinners due to Atrial Fibulation.

How much will this cost? I have had pneumonia 8 time last year. Not 1 specialist could find the bacteria causing this. By December of that year I almost passed away. I had just been dismissed by a hospital and sent home, and 1 hour layer I could barely breathe. I was filling up with fluid and foamy blood was coming out. The paramedics saved me and took me to another hospital The drs. found a serious heart condition, still waiting for open heart surgery. I fill up to my bronchials with fluid every few weeks, it bubbles up and I can hear gurgling. I have no lung problems, such as copd, or emphasyma. What can I do.

Hi, I got diagnosed with Pneumonia yesterday and have been sent home with antibiotics (amoxicillin and doxycycline) I was just wondering what the risk factors would be if I were to have at least one cigarette? I know it wouldn’t be good for the healing process(will probably slow it down) but is there any serious risk with smoking (ciggerattes or maybe even weed mixed with tobacco?) my doctor at the hospital that diagnosed me knew I smoked and also knew I smoked at least one or two bongs and he said NOTHING when I was leaving about trying not to smoke etc etc?

I have been sick for a week with what I thought was a head cold. My temp keeps going up and I m having trouble breathing. Sinuses are clear, ears are ringing but semi clear but hurt when swallowing along with sore throat. Non productive cough but lungs feel heavy and full. Could this be pneumonia I have developed?

Hello, im a female of 26, heavy smoker with last breath reading of 33 and drink daily. On Thursday I suffered from a severe headache which stayed until Friday evening, as the headache subsided I had a tingling and pressure sensation over head which was also over my nose. I have had no fever, cold etc Yesterday I felt very lightheaded and also after an episode of diarrea this morning am lightheaded again... I have no trouble breathing as such but I suffer from anxiety which I think has been happening alot today. I have had some twinge type pains in my lower chest ( like at the bottom of ribs) for a few days but not necessarily when I breath in and out and when I do cough I have had mucus? Come up, it s almost like it s stuck in my throat also.... I have some head pressure and am getting cold feet every now and then everything I ve checked says pneumonia does this sound like what I could have or could it just be anxiety, I m a little worried...the symptoms separately come and go but my head stays feeling.a little heavy! Chills now and again

Im constantly falling asleep and keep having a fever on and off all the time. I went to the urgent care a week ago n they said i had the beginning of pneumonia. He only gave me a zpack and some cough medicine. The thing is I feel worse not better at all....what should i do? 
I am a family doctor in an outpatient family medicine setting, and the question was raised reguarding treatment for community acquired pneumonia. If reoccurance of infection occurs, after treatment with z pack within 90 days how  should patient be treated. Would it be safe to treat again with levaquin as an outpatient? 
My husband (age 63 and in great health) was diagnosed with strep pneumonia and spent 3 days in the hospital, he was released with antibiotic Levaquin, after 5 days I had to bring him back to the ER because he spiked a fever of 101. They discovered that the original pneumonia of the right upper lung was almost gone but it had spread to the lower lobe. They discharged him with prescriptions for Azrithomycin 500 mg once a day for 7 days and Amox TR-K CLV 875-125 twice a day for 10 days. The Amox is making him very nauseated and he gets headaches from it. Can he stop taking it after 7 days instead of 10? Generally he is feeling better, no fever since beginning the two antibiotic combination? 
I was swimming in a pool on 2/15 and I slipped and went under the water unexpectedly and I wound up choking quite badly on some water.  I couldn't catch my breath and I felt like I had water in my lung that I couldn't expel with coughing.  Yesterday I began having a hacking cough and a sore throat (fells like my throats on fire).  Today I feel even worse, my cough is worse and sounds more "cruddy" and my throat still hurts, my head is pounding and my body is starting to ache.  Could I be developing aspiration pneumonia? 
I have pneumonia and I am on Levaquin with one day left on my cycle but i feel really crappy, tired, short tempered, headache, and my temperature is 97 do I have anything to worry about? Before taking the Levaquin my temperature was around 102.4 and normal for me is 98.6 on the money. 
My husband has advanced M.S.  After battling a cough for a month, he had a chest X Ray and we were told he had pneumonia. He was on an antibotic for 10 days which ended 1 week ago today. His nurse was here halfway through the dose and said his lungs sounded clear  He has not been coughing or a temprature in over a week. This evening he started coughing, phlegm is not discolored but when he coughs there is a strange odor that I can not describe. I have never smelled an odor like this 
I have been ill for 6 weeks and my GP suspected pneumonia and I was put on antibiotics.  The third one has almost cleared the infection.  However, I had an X-ray and it apparently showed nothing at all, although all my symptoms were in line with pneumonia and my GP had definitely heard a lot of crackles in the left lung.  Is it possible that I had pneumonia if the Xray was clear? 
i am a 14 year old female that was recently diagnosed with a slight bit of pneumonia, i took the antibiotics that i was supposed to take: once a day for 6 days, i completed it. But I want to know if I'm know cured, it's been a week or two since I finish the tablet treatment, How can I tell that i'm cured? 
My friend had pneumonia a few weeks ago and was given cipro and flagl antibiotics.  She had to return to the hospital two more time because of spiking temperatures.  Fluid was tested from her lungs and came back negative.  Could she possibly have contacted mersa? 
I am 33 years old, I was diagnosed with pneumonia almost a month ago after a short period of low grade fever and dry cough. Even after treatment with 4 courses of antibiotics dry cough has not resolved.I am having pain on the right lower side of the rib which is constant and experiencing back pain and pains all over my back and chest in a nonspecific pattern. A chest CT was performed and found subsegmental consolidatory changes in the anterior and lateral basal segments of right lower lobe with bronchial wall thickening, minimal ground glass opacification in the adjacent posterior and medial basal segments, few small mediastinal and axillary lymph nodes, plus few lymph nodes seen in the pretracheal region, few of them showing dense calcification.My last lab report from december 23rd is as followsTOTAL COUNT-7200/cummNeutrophils-70%, Lymphocytes-28%, Eosinophils-2%ESR-28 mm/hr.Still I am having fatigue, dry cough and pains. What can it be? 
I ve had pneumonia numerous times always in my left lung. The last time was a year ago, it never went away. My pulmonary explained that the disease is between all the scar tissue. I also have Crohns Disease and am treated with remicade. After several C-Scans which showed a mass and biopsies and cultures which came back negative,I had the left lung completely removed last month and was diagnosed with pulmonary eosinothioia. Does this sound correct? 
I had a fever from Friday to yesterday (Sunday), along with a cough. The temperature is now gone, but my cough is still here. I have been clearing my throat for a couple of weeks, but the coughing part started I believe on Saturday. Today, the cough is breaking, and other then the cough I feel 100% fine. Do I have pneumonia? 
I was diagnosed with double pneumonia 1 week ago having had the symptoms for a week, I have been on heavy penicillin and am left with weakness and a bad cough. My query is that my urine is reddish brown, looks like some blood could be there. Is this part of pneumonia. Thank you for your time. Jean aged 72 and normally healthy except for overweight. 
NAME: Brent AGE: 22 SEX: Male SYMPTOMS : I have a cough that seems to be reccursive. It occurs usually at nightime, or if I gave a very intense sneeze or laugh. When this cough occurs, it is very dry, that it would sound like a yelping dog. Also, besides cough, I do experience a reccursive runny nose, sometimes coupled with watery red eyes and itchy throat. The runny nose discharge is transparent, almost like saliva or tears. Ironically, after a while, these symptoms would disappear, and when they do disappear, I feel completely normal. I have already consulted a doctor and was diagnosed of allergic rhinits. She adviced me to take anti histamines, either zirtec or iterax, which ever do i prefer. Unfortunately, it works at often but not at all times. HOW MANY DAYS?:Reccursive cough has been going on since april of this year. As for the runny nose, since november of last year ALLERGIES: not that i know of, When I was five years old, I remember being diagnosed of Primary Complex, but was able to be treated before it goes into something else. Also, TB runs in the family, as my uncle had it before, and so as my mom (although the doctor said it was already a scar). As for me, 2009 was a stressful year. There were months, when my hours of daily sleep was only around 3 to four hours due to school work. Also, for a period of time I was involved in smoking, although it has been a month since I stopped. Doctor, I would just like to know what are the chances of me, acquiring respiratory illness like pneumonia or tuberculosis, or development of asthma? Also, if i get to consult a doctor personally with my parents, will the doctor be able to detect my past smoking habit, based on the procedures he will do, or with tests that he will recommend like xray? The truth is, I am hesitant to go to a medical clinic, because my parents have to accompany me, and I am afraid that the doctor might make "bisto"  towards my parents, as they don't know that I do smoke. But i do really want to seek medical attention. Besides the incovenicence of symtpoms, I am worried that it might be something serious. Hoping for a  share of your brilliant expertise. thank you doctor and good day. 
my boyfriend was put in the hospital for strep a nemonia 5 days ago yesterday they done another x ray and said that his nemonia was getting worse and had spread to his left lung and was also in his right real bad they also done a culture on the stuff that hes been coughing up out of his lungs and today they told us he has staph in his lungs how dangerous is this and what should be done

Hello. About 3-4 weeks ago I was diagnosed with pneumonia. After two weeks I felt well enough to start getting back out, but I continued to cough up mucus. I got in the swimming pool last night and it was an outdoor pool and kind of cool. this morning I woke up with fever, wheezing bad and my back in my lung area hurts so bad. The coughing is getting worse too. Could the pneumonia have came back or never left? What should I do?

My sister has recently had a bone marrow transplant. In June she had a lung infection and since has had breathing problems. She has just been readmitted and a scan showed pneumonia, pus and fluid has been drained and further tests have shown she has a fistula? If this is treated will her breathing problems be eased? 
my son who is 19, suffered from mono last spring with a tonsillar abscess requiring hospitalization for steroid and antibiotic infusion. due to how ill he was, they did not want to remove the tonsils but recommended he have them removed when he improved. he went off to college, became ill, was diagnosed with pneumonia and still had a positive mono spot. so we were unable to schedule it for the christmas break as we planned but now he has a piece of his tonsil that is actually hanging off=it looks like the strands between his cryptic tonsil areas broke off and left this piece dangling. it is umcomfortable but i am not sure if it is emergent. no fever or c/o sore throat right now, but overall still not up to par since this continued bouts of illness.

Hi, may I answer your health queries right now ?  Please type your query here...I have been to the doctor 2 times. First time, it was a severe sinus infection, week later had to go back, turned into pneumonia, had to go back third time. All 3 times I was given a shot, antibotics & c-pack first time, steroids, antibotics & shot second and antibotics & shot third. I have been hurting under my ribs and has gone to my back and shoulder. Do you think the pneumonia has gotten worse? Do I need to go back to the doctor? 
My father 82 years old was in the hospital for pneumonia and per cardiac catherization showing blockage. It was diagnosed that blockage was too much for bypass or stent. Only medication is given to help heart. Heart muscles also showed dead so it was no use to have bypass surgery per cardiac physician as even if blockage removed muscles would not help heart. My question is that now released from home he has been very uncomfortable during night sleep. He moans while asleep. He gets up and sits on bed. He then lays back and the same continues. He states being tired from hospital stay. He states he is tired from stay in hospital like hospital bed etc.  He really gets to sleep at 6 am and then during the day he is fine. Then the next night it starts again. Has been home since Feb. 2. Current medical doctor provided meds to sleep but that was worse. My mother is the primary caretaker and has reported his night sleep is off after returning home. Does the new diagnosis cause this or is there is a reason. Thanks. 
Dear Dr.Mahashur, i have been diagonised with 'MYCOPLASMIC PNEUMONIA' by a Dr in Singapore,(mycoplasmic pneumonia antibody fbc=  >1:1280) and am now on a 20-days course of 'avelox' ( moxifloxacin 400 mg) and have also been advised to take steroids for 10 days. I have already gone through a course of antibiotics to treat pneumonia (CLAVICEF)and TB has been eliminated by carrying out a bronchoscopy and lab analysis for TB.

A friend of mine has been treated for an, as yet unidentified, intestinal parasite with the antibiotic Levofloxacin. He was also diagnosed with a right lower lobe pneumonia discovered on CT scan. His physician told him that the antibiotic would take of both the pneumonia and the parasite. As a NP, I am familiar with Levaquin s use to combat pneumonia but the only antibiotics I can find for use as an antiparasitic are Tetracyline and Emycin if Metronidazole cannot be tolerated. Is Levofloxacin now also being used the way Emycin might be used in the absence of Flagyl?

A round of stronger antibiotics were then given to her. She went back for a follow up xray last week and the xray now shows the pneumonia is in both lungs. The strange thing is...she has NO symptoms. No coughing, no fever, nothing. Could it possibly be viral? or fluid? or cancer???? Btw she has never smoked in her life.

I am really having a hard time with this. Help!

They gave me a antibiotic shot and a 1/10day script for levaquin which I started about 10am Friday morning. I m still not feeling better. I now as of this morning have a sharp pain inbetween shoulder blades that comes and goes, my heart flutters sometimes and sometimes beats really fast, I also woke up to chest pain that would go from burning feeling to sharp pain for about 30 min consecutively, then stopped and has been on and off since then. My cough is so bad that when I cough it feels like my ribs/lower sides of my back/lung area are bruised/fractured and takes my breath away when I take deap breathes or bend my waiste. I noticed bout a 5 days ago that I would get really hot at random times. Ao thinking i was having a fever, I ve been keeping track daily of my bt as of about 3/4 days ago and it s seems to have steadily slowly dropped. It s ranging usually from 96-97 but sometimes it ll get to like 98.0 and thats while I m sweating so bad that s my shirt will be soaked and hair wet like I was standing outside in the sun for an hr in middle of summer. It s sick. Should I be worried? 
my son is 3 years old, and came down with a head cold wed, it moved immediately to his chest (he is a preemie-grad, and has had trouble with pneumonia and rsv in past) he is running a temp, and his respiratory rate is between 48-50.  I just don't know if i should wait it out a little longer to see what the day brings or take him in. I hate feelling like i'm always there for the slightest things with him, but his history proves medical intervention always was the case. It just seems so quick that a lung issue would be evident, when he only started showing signs of a cold wednesday night. 
What is the advisability of exercise in the year following treatment with Levofloxaxin for pneumonia? I just completed 5 days of treatment with pills after 4 or more days of IV in the hospital following gall bladder surgery. I entered the hospital with pneumonia (not knowing I had it), probably having contracted it from my brother who had it and whom I had visited several days earlier in another hospital. I am 71 years old, female; I had a non-heart damaging heart attack in 2003 and have tried to maintain a good exercise program to lessen my chances of worsening heart disease. Should I resume Naproxen for joint/muscle pain; had 2 doses (2 tablets twice daily) 2 days before hospitalization. Did not need it the 3rd day and was hospitalized the next day. Did not take it post hospitalization. Do not remember if they gave it in hospital; think not. Thank you. 
I have had a Percocet addiction for 35 years and have had many Dr.s in that time span. I was up to without exaggeration, eating 240 10mg p s, 98 30mg oxycodone pills, as well as an assortment of 5mg pills which were always at my disposal. I have cancer and have severe back injuries but along with the p s I also had monthly access to 240 2mg xannax pills which after awhile Ihad no problem eating all of the above each month and would look for some more. I died 4 times in a 6 year span due to double pneumonia which the Dr.s told me my medications were playing a large roll in this. When I was 16 I became an atheist due to my brother dying, he was my favorite and I became very drug dependent to kill the pain. This lead to my later addictions and no matter what I tried I could not escape their grip.The last time I was in the hospital I said Lord I do not know if you are real but if you are I am begging you to open my heart again to you and I need your help or this will probably be it for me when I leave the hospital, I have had enough, and this is only the drug portion of my life I would not wish the things and amount of death I have had to witness on anyone. I am the last of all my friends left alive and I am 53years old. Over 40 friends have passed on, 2 of which I grew up with from the age of 5, others just would not listen. I lost 2 older brothers, 1 my 1st year in highschool the other 8 years later of an overdose. Needless to say ptsd, depression and other problems haunted me until I did as many drugs as possible to bury the pain, but demons only stay buried so long which I found out the hard way. tiny2882@comcat,net 
I was recently released from hospital, I had pneumonia. After 1 week, I have finished the oral antibiotics. 2 days later, the sweats have returned (no temperature) and I am feeling generally unwell.

I have continued my physiotherapy to bring up whatever is in my lungs. The cramping I am now experiencing is excruciatingly painful. I just don t know what to do next. I live in a remote area and accessing a doctor or hospital is difficult. Please help.

My fiancé has been coughing uncontrollably every night for the past 4 months. He is 23 years old, 5'9", about 140 lbs., and has been told by his dr that he has walking pneumonia. He has been prescribed antibiotics, cough syrup, allergy medicine, mucinex, nasal sprays, and inhalers and although they suppress the coughing at times he still does not seem to have gotten rid of the coughing. His coughing is accompanied with phlegm and has also caused him to throw up due to the extremity. He does smoke cigars as well. What is this!? 
How can one be sure of a diagnosis of pneumonia or pertusses in adults. How do you compare? My doc thinks I have pertusses. But the doctor in Mexico where I was originally treated said I had PB pneumonia. I was on intravenous antibiotics for three days in Mexico before coming home to my dr.here in L.A.The xrays showed lots of mucus in my lungs.  I am confused.  is there a definitive test for petusses in adults? Dr said I will be fine. Gave me ADVAIR and cough medicine and says I will be fine but will cough for a pretty long while until the lungs are clear.  He said I do not need antibiotics because I have already had zpack and 10 days of ampicillin, and then 3 days fo intravenous antibiotics. Who do I believe? I am 65 years old. never was feeling this sick or tired before or have had any kind of lung involvement in my life.  I am a strong healthy woman. No immune deficiency or anything like that. 
Went to the doctor 3 weeks ago for possible exercise induced asthma due to chest pain. They have me a daily steriod inhaler and albuterol rescue inhaler. The did an xray as well and a few days later I found out I had pneumonia. I did a zpack for 5 days and now levaquin 500mg twice daily on day 7 or 10. Just last night I went to urgent they said I still have the pneumonia got a steroid injection and a medrol dose pack. Still getting worse...not sure what to do and the chest pain seems worse, and the levaquin has made my stomach very irritated which is expected. The steroids make sleeping impossible and I constantly feel overheated since the injections and dose pack I started yesterday. 
I went to the doctor today and found out that I have pneumonia. I got a steroid injection and breathing treatment in the office and was sent home with levaquin, albuterol, and cough medicine. My forearms and legs are very tingly and almost numb and heavy feeling. Is this from the steroid injection? I am 23 years old and I have juvenile rheumatoid arthritis so I am also taking humira, methotrexate, plaquenil, and folic acid for the RA. Is this a side effect or a drug reaction or nothing to be concerned about?
