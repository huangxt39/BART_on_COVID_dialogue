Description
I have cough with no travel history. Is this a symptom of Covid-19?

Dialogue
Patient:
Hello doctor, I get a cough for the last few days, which is heavy during night times. No raise in temperature but feeling tired with no travel history. No contact with any Covid-19 persons. It has been four to five days and has drunk a lot of Benadryl and took Paracetamol too. Doctors have shut the OP so do not know what to do? Please help.
Doctor:
Hello, I understand your concern. I just have a few more questions.
Does your cough has phlegm? Any other symptoms like difficulty breathing? Any other medical condition such as asthma, hypertension? Are you a smoker? Alcoholic beverage drinker?
Patient:
Thank you doctor,
I have phlegm but not a lot. A tiny amount comes out most of the time. I have no difficulty in breathing. No medical conditions and not a smoker nor a drinker.
Doctor:
Hi, I would recommend you take n-acetylcysteine 200 mg powder dissolved in water three times a day. You may also nebulize using PNSS (saline nebulizer) three times a day. This will help the phlegm to come out. I would also recommend you take vitamin C 500 mg and zinc to boost your immune system. If symptoms persist, worsen or new onset of symptoms has been noted, further consult is advised.

I have a little fever with no history of foreign travel or contact. What is the chance of Covid-19?

Dialogue
Patient:
Hello doctor, I am suffering from coughing, throat infection from last week. At that time fever did not persist and also did not felt any chest pain. Two days later, I consulted with a doctor. He prescribed Cavidur 625, Montek LC, Ambrolite syrup and Betaline gargle solution. Since then throat infection improved and frequent cough also coming out. Coughing also improved remarkably though not completely. From yesterday onwards fever is occuring (maximum 100-degree Celcius). I have not come in touch with any foreign returned person nor went outside. In our state, there is no incidence of Covid-19. Please suggest what to do?
Doctor:
Hello, I can understand your concern.
In my opinion, you should get done a chest x-ray and CBC (complete blood count). If both these are normal then no need to worry much. I hope this helps.
Patient:
Thank you doctor,
After doing all these I can upload all for further query.
Doctor:
Hi, yes, upload in this query only. I will see and revert to you.
Patient:
Thank you doctor,
As per your guidelines, I have made one test. Due to city shutdown, I could not able to make an x-ray of chest. Fever is coming every 12 hours. But cough does not persist currently. The only problem is a fever. I am uploading the blood examination report. Please advice.
Doctor:
Hi, I can understand your concern. I have gone through the report you have attached. (attachment removed to protect patient identity).
Your total count is on the higher side of normal along with low hemoglobin. So start Azithromycin 500 mg 1-0-0, Tablet Dolo 650 1-0-1. Once your fever and cough subside, start an Iron tablet for low hemoglobin.
I hope this helps.
Patient:
Thank you doctor,
How many tablets of Azithromycin to be taken? Is it in the morning? I want to make you know that I have already taken Azithromycin five days before. Should she start it? And also can I start an Iron tablet today itself?
Doctor:
Hi, Yes, you can take iron tablet from today onwards. And no need for Azithromycin now as you have already taken it. Drink plenty of fluids orally and keep yourself hydrated. Do warm water gargles and steam inhalation four to five times a day.

Can Coronavirus cause itchiness in throat and shortness of breath?

Dialogue
Patient:
Hello doctor,
I am a 23-year-old man. I have anxiety and depression but no immunodeficiency disorders or chronic diseases. First, I wanna know if my immune system is weakened and how likely am I to die of Coronavirus.
Second, I have itchiness in my throat and shortness of breath. I always have it because of anxiety but now it is more persistent than before. I also feel a very subtle feeling of pain, burning sensation and itchiness in my chest. I did not go out during the past ten days and have not been in contact with someone with positive Covid. And I quit smoking past week. Down to one or zero cigarettes from 20 a day. Why am I feeling itchiness and pain and burning sensation? How likely am I to have Covid-19? And how likely am I to die from it?
Doctor:
Hello. Anxiety can manifest itself in physical or psychological symptoms or both. The irritation sensation you are experiencing is a part of your anxiety. Also please do not believe the hype about covid. It has a low mortality rate, of 2-3 percent, that too mortality is very high in people above 60-70 years with other co-morbidities. You do not have any such disorders and you have not even been in contact with anyone, so do not worry.
Please continue to take your medicines for anxiety if you are taking them, if not, please consider visiting a psychiatrist and get started on some low dose SSRI type of medicines. Also, if needed a low dose Benzodiazepines can be added temporarily. Also, please do some deep breathing exercises, or progressive muscle relaxation. You can also take some honey with water to reduce the itching in the throat and also try doing some gargles with lukewarm salt water.

I have chills, breathing problems and cough with white phlegm. Could it be Coronavirus infection?

Dialogue
Patient:
Hello doctor,
Last night I was getting chills, feeling more cold than usual and lightheaded and a lot of burping. Maybe like every 30 minutes or less or so feel more chills running down my body and chest feeling bit weird like I am starting having trouble breathing then goes back to normal and repeats, with weird feeling like chills down my left and right lungs or left and right upper chest. Also, my heart was pumping fast. Also, some minor coughs were there since seven days ago, still here. I have white mucus and have not gotten yellow yet.
I took medicines yesterday but today I got severe cold and flu medicine with a pain reliever, the chills did not go away. Then today, I called the doctor on the phone and told him what happen last night and the same thing happened this morning too. I had minor coughs, feeling lightheaded, feel like maybe cannot breathe or something, and a lot of burping. I told him the burping issue was going on for at least two years, but somehow this time I am feeling lightheaded. He just gives Pepcid, a try maybe GERD. I ate that today still feeling chills now and still burping a lot.
Right now, still some chills on arms, with breathing issue or something makes my chest feel weird and arm sometimes. So, should I be worried? I do not think I have a fever now but do not feel hot on the forehead? Was it GERD or flu, it is Coronavirus or something else? I hope it is not Coronavirus.
I am 21 years old and weigh around 110-115 kg.
Doctor:
Hello,
please answer the following:
Any travel history in the last one month? Any use of airports? Any fever, have you checked the temperature? Any cough? Any mucus or phlegm? How is your sleep? Is there any malaise or body aches or weakness?
Patient:
Thank you doctor,
I travel to school, nearby grocery stores in the bus. No airport exposure. I have not checked the temperature. I do not feel hot or anything. I have minor coughs and sore throat. Yes, I have mucus which seems white or clear for now.
During sleep, I do not have much aches. Last night I have not got much sleep, probably because I was thinking about stuff being worried, but got some sleep though.
Doctor:
Hi, most probably with the history it does not appear like a severe problem or Coronavirus infection. Is sore throat severe and does the pain last the whole day? Do you smoke or drink?
Can you try taking Sudafed, Tylenol, and Zyrtec and try getting sleep for a few days? I am sure that will make you feel better.
Avoid exposure to smoke dust and cold winds. Keep the AC to a minimum or use ceiling fan instead. Drink plenty of water and warm fluids. Avoid eating out, partying. Avoid unnecessary travel.
You need not quarantine yourself in the strictest manner but some amount of restrictions in interacting and meeting with the community is advised.
Lastly, where are you currently? Your place of residence and country? Is it a Corona endemic country? Did you talk to or interact with any known or suspected flu patient?
Can you please take a picture of the back of the throat with open mouth showing details of the tonsils and pharyngeal wall and send it to me?
Patient:
Thank you doctor,
I woke up this morning, I had trouble sleeping being worried, but I got some sleep then nearby phone ringing woke me up.
So far, seems no one got any severe coughs or pain so far. I only hear minor coughs the past week or so. Thanks for those medicine recommendations for sleep. I fall asleep quicker, usually, it takes me around one hour to fall asleep on most days.
I will try to avoid smoking as much as possible. Yes, I will be staying inside since many places are on lockdown. And school is online. I recently turned on the air purifier to clean up some air for allergies possible viruses but makes me cold. I might not need AC unless really hot.
I will be staying home for the next month at least. My chills right now are feeling a bit better, but a little sick only because maybe I did not get enough sleep.
I stay in San Francisco CA, United States, and there are close to 40 confirmed cases around here. No severe reports near my district, and have not heard anyone in serious condition.
So, last week I have a sore throat and tonsil pain while swallowing for a few days, then one day drank a lot of honey and water and some tea, then it got better. Not sure if it got smaller, but the pain was less now though. Between my tonsils in the middle (behind the tongue) looks like my throat, got some red stuff, maybe looks like inflamed or rashes. Any recommendations? Any foods or drinks that can help?
Doctor:
Hi, you have got it right. Follow all the precautions. You will be alright soon. Try getting a good sleep tonight.
I heard about the cases in SF. My brother was supposed to fly there from India for work but his meeting got canceled in the wake of the virus.
Yes, your camera has not done a decent job this time around. It has not focussed on our area of interest. (attachment removed to protect patient identity). But yours has picked up the two big bumps in the back of the throat (enlarged tonsils).
The tonsils could be enlarged due to the current infection and sore throat problem you are having. Once the problem is resolved they should get back to their normal size, which I guess, in you, must be slightly big. The pharyngeal wall between the tonsils could be having some granular bumps which are quite common during an infection.
Now you do not worry, for most such infections are due to viruses (not Corona). They usually get better with time and supportive treatment. Traditional Indian forms of medicine advise honey and hot water. Tea makes a good addition I guess. Sudafed and Zyrtec appropriate for your weight will help additionally. Tylenol every time you got pain will help you tide over this period wonderfully.
Now watch for some warning symptoms fever, increased pain, thick mucus, thick postnasal drip, severe malaise, swelling in the neck, etc. In such cases promptly revert to me. You may need a Z pack then.
Patient:
Thank you doctor,
As of now 12:40 PM I am breathing harder than usual since 30 minutes ago. I only ate some breakfast and drank water.
Here is my story: Before Feb 28th - no issues at all, besides always burping a lot, sometimes bloating, no coughs, tonsil was enlarged for a while, no lightheadedness, no breathing problems, not sick.
Friday February 28th - I woke up feeling unwell, drank water went back to bed, came back out super lightheaded about to faint, lied on bed for an hour, came out stomach feeling weird, even more lightheaded about to faint, can barely even eat a little noodles and two small pieces of spam, vomited it, then four more times which as water or acid. Hours later was better.
Saturday February 29th - diarrhea
Sunday March 1st - diarrhea
Monday March 2 - diarrhea
Tuesday March 3 - diarrhea
Wednesday March 4 - No stool
Thursday March 3 - No more diarrhea
Friday March 4th - Monday March 9th - no issues
Monday March 9th - feeling better, no problems, enlarged tonsil, no coughs really.
Sunday march 15 - no problems besides burping, minor coughs, some sore throat
Afternoon I ate chicken, burping a lot, stomach uncomfortable, felt like breathing problems, chills on hands, chest and left and right side, felt like could not breathe. 20 minutes later, still chills breathing a bit better, lightheaded kind of feel like fainting, then went to bed for 15 minutes (the breathing problem and weird chest feeling comes back randomly), ate tums, then later I drank cough and flu medicine.
On Monday march 16 - woke up around 11:30 AM, feeling breathing problems, chills around body, lightheaded again, chest feeling weird, burping a lot, and I described my story to doctor he said it sounds like you ate something bad, does sound like GERD, of course we do not know for sure unless lab tests maybe on stool. He asked have you tried stronger antacids like Pepcid or Zantac?
I said no. Then doctor asked me to try Pepcid and tell me how it goes.
Tuesday and Wednesday March 16/17 - feeling better, no lightheadedness, no more chills, minor coughs, sore throat, burping a lot, no breathing problems so far. Pepcid no problems so far besides making me burp almost all day.
Wednesday night still coughing a lot and drank severe cold and flu medicine.
Thursday march 21 I woke up fine, then once ate Pepcid and drank some water, heart rate was going really fast, started to make worried, called doctor office they said can you count your beats per minute, then I counted, my phone was showing my heart rating going to 120 bpm, when I counted to them was not 120 bpm, then they told me to call back if it gets worse. Then shortly after, I drank some water and ate a little bit of breakfast. My heart rate started to drop slowly and was getting better after that.
Friday march 20- 10 AM I woke up with some chest pains (chest area above the stomach), then some coughing and feeling a little sick, little lightheaded, heart beating fast, breathing harder, felt of shortness of breath. Drank some water and breathe harder, a little bit of mucus.
15-20 minutes later no more chest pains, still breathing harder.
11 AM - still breathing a little bit harder than usual, coughing would make me breathe even harder. Better now, but still breathing a little harder than usual.
11:30 AM moving makes me breathe harder, sat in bed.
11:58 AM - feeling a bit better
12:10 - feeling like breathing a harder than usual.
After an hour later, feeling better now which is strange. Not sure if its heart problems, acid reflux, chest issues, or esophagus.
Doctor:
Hello, always Protonix is better than Zantac. Try using Protonix (Pantoprazole). Do not lie down immediately after consuming meals. Do not drink a lot of water after a meal. Avoid spicy and oily foods.
Patient:
Thank you doctor,
I went to the store to look for Zantac they did not have it, so I talked to the pharmacy they said sounds like could be some weird chest tightening and the doctor said since Pepcid and Zantac are the same. He said to try Ranitidine.
Right now I tried Pepcid again like now, for the first five to ten minutes I think it means me feel more nervous or anxiety or something, I tried to calm myself by putting fingers on teeth. Then I think now it did not cause my heart to beat super fast this time which was strange. Even water makes my heart beat a little faster. Should I stick with Pepcid? Finish the entire bottle? I think it has 20-30 pieces.
I used to lie down after a meal a few years ago like I get hungry before I go to bed then I started eating snacks and lying down. Sometimes I starve myself. Sometimes I wake up with acid feeling in my mouth.
I don't know why I woke up this morning with chest pain, like the middle area right above the stomach and felt like I had breathing problems, breathing harder than usual, drank water and barely could eat breakfast (lasted for at least 30 minutes+). I then waited a bit after 10 minutes, drank hot water and ate breakfast, I started to breathe better again.
Could it be shortness or breath? May be blood pressure? Esophagus issue? Chest issue? Heart issue? I am having weird breathing. Should I be worried?
Doctor:
Hi, you need to take Pantoprazole or any other proton pump inhibitor. Avoid heavy meals. The issue appears like a heartburn problem due to acidity only. It does not appear sinister.
Patient:
Thank you doctor,
I was trying to finish the bowl of food in one hour. I was eating veggies and rice, halfway through felt something like acid may be some pain in chest and throat. Feeling lightheaded so ate some meat to then coughed after.
Doctor:
Hi, do not worry about it. Drink plenty of water but not immediately after a meal. Eat well cooked meats.
Patient:
Thank you doctor, 
I really appreciate your help so much. I appreciate your time and effort to help me and give advice. Only thing I am worried is just the chest pains, breathing issues and esophagus and throat stuff. I will try to wait two to three hours after eating or drinking before bed now. I hope to get less chest issues when I wake up.
Doctor:
Hi, do not worry so much. You will be absolutely alright. Give it some time. If you are not getting better we can do laryngoscopy and check if there is anything wrong with the larynx. Do you eat healthy food and do exercises?
Patient:
Yeah if it doesn't get better Laryngoscopy would be perfect. Okay, I'll give it some time Thank you!
I try to eat vegetables and fruits. I don't eat much junk food that much. I used to eat more junk years ago, but now mostly vegetables, fruits, meat (pork, chicken, beef, fish) usually not fried, and tried to eat whole wheat bread with fried chicken patty from the super market (for school lunch) since its cheap and its chicken (stopped now after acid problems), don't really eat french fries, pizza or drink soda etc...
Exercise, haven't been exercising these few months. I have been telling myself that, but then i haven't really been doing it. Used to a lot years ago, now barely.
Since high school, when i exercise running when i try to get air feels like throat is tight or chest is tight and air is trying to squeeze its way through. After this point High school until college feels like i'm not breathing enough air. When i was younger (Elementary/middle school) felt like i gotten a lot more air then now through my throat and air doesn't squeezes through.
One doctor just used stethoscope for heart and lungs, told me to breathe hasn't said much about it. Then another doctor said, sounds you are not breathing that much, feels like not getting another air (in high school, like 4-6 years ago maybe), they didn't do much about it.
So, when i try to breath regularly, seems like not much air comes out through mouth even before acid reflux,.That's why recent breathing problems kinda worry me, but anyways yeah like that.
Doctor:
I guess you are in the right track. With regards to food diet and exercise.
Restart doing your exercise. Keep yourself active. Try having more than three meals a day but keep the quantity of each meal less than the usual. That way you eat more frequently but without putting weight or adding unnecessary calories.
Patient:
Sounds good! Awesome! Appreciate your time and effort to help, this means a lot. Very patient and kind!

Does COVID-19 spreads through water? What precautions should I take to avoid infection?

Dialogue
Patient:
Hi, I am Chaitanya, 27 years old. I use to swim daily in morning. Does COVID-19 spreads through water ? What precautions should I take to avoid infection?
Doctor:
Hello and welcome to Ask A Doctor service.
I have reviewed your query and here is my advice.
First few cases were suspected to have spread from food. However human to human spread is mainly from air droplets.
I would suggest you to refrain from swimming for sometime. Although the virus will get killed in swimming pool if it doesnot find host for more than few minutes.
Other precautions include to avoid social gatherings, wash hands frequently with soap and water, cover face with mask, stay home during sickness, avoid travel.
Hope it helps. Let me know if I can assist you further.

Symptoms of COVID-19 are usually the same as a cold or the flu, with diarrhea being uncommon.
The COVID-19 infection is worldwide. The goal is to keep people separated so that the clinics and hospitals are not overwhelmed. Patients with medical symptoms should see their primary care doctor on VIDEO or by PHONE, and get instructed to go to a clinic or ER only if not treatable by video or phone.

High likelihood if kissing and having intercourse but it may not be transmitted through intercourse but the closeness in an intimate situation like that with someone who is infected gives a high likelihood of transmission.

Great question. Yes asthma is a chronic lung disease which carries some increased risk with COVID-19.
Good asthma control along with good handwashwng, social distancing avoiding unnecessary travel along with your young age should keep your risk of complications low. Smoking, hypertension, diabetes, obesity or compromised immune system are also risk factors to be considered.

Doctor:
In brief: Not quite that way
People with chronic lung problems do worse in a lung disease outbreak.
For one specific person... well, there's no way to guess. "People" in general do worse if they have UNcontrolled lung disease. That means it's likely that asthmatics using inhaled steroids to give them good disease control will be BETTER OFF than asthmatics who use steroids but still cannot get good control. Be in good control.

Can Covid-19 be transmitted sexually? Can any coronavirus be transmitted sexually?
Doctor:
In brief: Sort of
If you are having sex with someone who has Covid-19 you are quite at risk of getting it.
High likelihood if kissing and having intercourse but it may not be transmitted through intercourse but the closeness in an intimate situation like that with someone who is infected gives a high likelihood of transmission.

Doctor:
In brief: COVID-19 mortality
Don't confuse actual mortality rate with REPORTED rate.
The actual rate probably will remain stable (and likely lower in the US than some other countries, because of sophisticated intensive medical care). But as testing expands and more people with mild symptoms (or no symptoms) are diagnosed, reported mortality will decline; likely happening now, but it may take weeks for data to be known.

Dialogue
Patient:
Last tuesday I had a flu shot and a neumonia shot. I am 68 and male. I had a very sore arm and felt bad the next day in which I had blood drawn for a test. The results showed a high white cell blood count as well as high ANC and AMC. Could these high readings be because of the shots the day before?
Doctor:
Hello, * The pneumonia shot per se is not responsible for high WBC count, but as you are telling there are soreness and bad feeling at the injection site over arm, there are all possibilities that you have cellulitis or possible abscess formation at the injection site; which will recruit neutrophils at the site and cause secondary rise in WBC count. * Primary relief with ice application and secondary management with systemic antibiotics and anti-inflammatory medicines with your doc. Hope I have answered your query.

I was given amoxycillin for a chest infection and did not improve after 48 hours, therefore I went back to the GP who then gave me Clarythmomycin as it resulted in pneumonia.

I still have an incredible amount of phlegm which has now changed from brown to sometimes green to clear. Unfortunately, for last 3 days, my trachea is extremely bruised to touch and feel as if someone is pressing my windpipe. Although my tonsils aren t swollen, my ear hurts deep inside. I have had to start taking paracetamol again this week as feel weak, wobbly and feel as if I am going backwards again instead of improving. I am 45 years old. Non-smoker.This is the 3rd time I have had pneumonia in 18 years. I am reasonably fit and healthy, and I don t suffer from colds normally, but whenever I come down with something, I seem to suffer with it. How long does it take to get back to normal?

Dialogue
Patient:
I have been on methadone for approx. 5 years now at a dose of 30mg taken 4 times daily. This has not only stopped any unpleasant withdrawl symptoms but has also offered considerable relief in easing chronic pain from a severe back injury 11 years ago. For the first 3 years of taking the medication I found that while it was effective in these areas their was an exceptional side effect in that it absolutely obliterated any interest in sex or even the ability to physically have sex. Also I found that I had next to no energy, making many things I used to enjoy fall by the wayside which in turn led to severe depression. After extensive talks with my Doctor I was sent for blood analysis and it was found that my level of testosterone was so low it barely registered. I was then put on a 3 week cycle of injections of 2mls of Delatestryl and for the past several years I have been the person that I used to be (it gave me my life back). Know I have been given a new Doctor at the clinic I attend and he has informed me that he is only there to prescribe methadone and will not be responsible for any other prescriptions. I do not have a family doctor and our emerg has said that this falls outside their domain. The walk in clinic treats every individual that I know so badly that their is no doubt in my mind that they will refuse to continue this presciption.

Can Nyquil be taken instead of steroid shot for pneumonia?

Dialogue
Patient:
I was given a steroid shot at 10am this morning when it was discovered that I have potential pneumonia. I was also proscribed an inhaler and a strong antibiotic, both of which I am now actively taking as directed. The Dr offered a cough syrup with codeine for assistance with sleeping through the symptoms that have been interfering with my ability to sleep, which I declined due to being someone who never takes medications at all and fear of having so much in my system at once. The Dr. clarified that Nyquil would be just fine if needed and if I m more comfortable with. I m having some anticipated potential insomnia from the steroid, and some heart palpitations, and I have an irregular heart palpitations to begin with. I feel inclined to take the Nyquil to ensure I get desperately needed sleep, but am concerned with all that is on board, etc. Definitive guidance would be so greatly appreciated, thank you in advance!
Doctor:
Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. * The Nyquil with its components help to relieve congestion, body ache, allergy related uneasiness.* It is not a substitute for steroid, but will help definitely in your case for symptoms control. Wish you fine recovery.Take care.

Dialogue
Patient:
Hello, I have had a chest infection about once a quarter for the last year and a half . I was diagnosed with asthma not long ago as well as having developed pneumonia for the first time in the past week. What could be causing such frequent illness? I have generally been a healthy person for all of my life. Sick maybe once every four years.
Doctor:
Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. Recurrent chest infections in asthma patients can cause bronchitis. So better to consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system and PFT (Pulmonary Function Test). PFT will not only diagnose bronchitis but it will also tell you about severity of the disease and treatment is based on severity only. You will mostly improve with inhaled bronchodilators (Formoterol or Salmeterol) and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) (Budesonide or Fluticasone). Don't worry, you will be alright with all these.  Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further.  Wish you good health!  Thanks.

Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. In my opinion, you should definitely consult pulmonologist for this pain. You will need a chest X-ray and PFT (Pulmonary Function Test). A chest X-ray is needed to rule out recurrence of pneumonia because this can also cause similar kind of pain.

I am recovering from pnuemonia. I was thinking that that I tore a muscle coughing but now I am beginning to wonder. On the right side of my chest, under my breast it hurts when I cough. It hurts when I press on it, but when I pinchthe muscles with my fingers I have no tenderness. It hurts as i go to touch my toes. Could I be having a problem with an organ under my ribs ? I have no pain on my left side.
Doctor:
Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service. I have reviewed your query and here is my advice. Pneumonia can cause pleurisy (inflammation of pleura) and this can cause similar kind of pain. So in my opinion, you should first get the chest X-ray done. If the chest X-ray is worsening, then your pain is due to pneumonia and you will need higher antibiotics. But if the chest X-ray is improving, then possibility of musculoskeletal pain is more likely. So apply warm water pad on the affected areas. Avoid movements causing pain. Avoid sudden jerky movements of the chest. Take simple painkillers and muscle relaxant drugs like Ibuprofen and Thiocolchicoside. Don't worry, you will be alright with all these.  Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.

Doctor:
Hello and Welcome to ‘Ask A Doctor’ service.I have reviewed your query and here is my advice.Pneumonia causes pleurisy (inflammation of pleura).

Doctor:
Hello,To be honest, there is a chance of cross infection from one person to another. However, this depends on so many factors and most of the infections, especially bacterial pneumonia, do not transmit easily. If more than one arm distance, the chance is very little and if not too close (like kissing etc.) the chance is further reduced. If two of them are already on antibiotics, as in your case, there is a chance but in the setting what u described, it is extremely unlikely. Hope I have answered your query.

Doctor:
Hello,Any infection if severe can suppress bone marrow. And this is responsible for low WBC (white blood cells) count. So better to start injectable antibiotics for control of infection. She may need leucovorin injection to stimulate bone marrow for producing WBCs. Once her infection is controlled, she will have a normal WBC count. Hope I have answered your query.

Hello,Since, you are feeling better after albuterol (inhaled bronchodilator), possibility of bronchitis (inflammation of airways) is more likely for your symptoms.Bronchitis is common after lung infection (pneumonia). So, it is better to consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system and PFT (Pulmonary Function Test).PFT will not only diagnose bronchitis but it will also tell you about severity of the disease and treatment is based on severity only.You will mostly improve with inhaled bronchodilators (formoterol or salmeterol) and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) (budesonide or fluticasone).Hope I have answered your query.

Are heaviness in the lungs, tinnitus and breathlessness symptoms of pneumonia?

Dialogue
Patient:
I have been sick for a week with what I thought was a head cold. My temp keeps going up and I m having trouble breathing. Sinuses are clear, ears are ringing but semi clear but hurt when swallowing along with sore throat. Non productive cough but lungs feel heavy and full. Could this be pneumonia I have developed? I have at it before. I must tell you that I do have asthma. Thank you!
Doctor:
Hello,In my opinion, you should definitely consult a pulmonologist. There are two main possibilities for your symptoms. 1. Lung infection (pneumonia).2. Worsening of asthma.So you will need a chest x-ray and PFT (Pulmonary Function Test). A chest x-ray is needed to rule out lung infection. PFT is needed to know the severity of asthma. You may need antibiotics, longer acting inhaled bronchodilators (formoterol or salmeterol) and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) (budesonide or fluticasone).Don't worry you will be alright with all these.Hope I have answered your query.

Patient:
Hello, im a female of 26, heavy smoker with last breath reading of 33 and drink daily. On Thursday I suffered from a severe headache which stayed until Friday evening, as the headache subsided I had a tingling and pressure sensation over head which was also over my nose. I have had no fever, cold etc Yesterday I felt very lightheaded and also after an episode of diarrea this morning am lightheaded again... I have no trouble breathing as such but I suffer from anxiety which I think has been happening alot today. I have had some twinge type pains in my lower chest ( like at the bottom of ribs) for a few days but not necessarily when I breath in and out and when I do cough I have had mucus? Come up, it s almost like it s stuck in my throat also.... I have some head pressure and am getting cold feet every now and then everything I ve checked says pneumonia does this sound like what I could have or could it just be anxiety, I m a little worried...the symptoms separately come and go but my head stays feeling.a little heavy! Chills now and again

Dialogue

I've been recently having more nose bleeds lately. 4-5 times per day to be exact. And I have the worst cough ever that comes with it. Even when I am asleep my nose starts to bleed and I wake up due to the blood running down my mouth. Is this pneumonia?! Or some other illness?
Doctor:
Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic.I can understand your concern. Pneumonia is less likely to cause nose bleeding. Recurrent nose bleeding with coughing are commonly seen with sinusitis. So better to consult ENT doctor and get done clinical examination and CT scan of paranasal sinuses (PNS). Also get done chest x ray for pneumonia. If chest x ray is normal then no need to worry for pneumonia. You may also need endoscopic evaluation of sinuses if CT PNS is suggestive of infection or erosion.Don't worry, you will be alright with all these. Hope I have solved your query.

Patient:
About 6 weeks ago I was diagnosed with PE in right lung and phnemoia in the left lung. I was in teh hospital for 9 days. I am on 20mg of Warfin per day! My blood levels are holding steady at 2.67. Yesterday I had a bit of lower back pain and today it is between my shoulder blades, mostly on my right side. It hurts my back to breathe, swallow, and move. Just sore muscles or could it be something serious with the blood clot? I hate to rush into the doctor if it is nothing....I hope you can help! Thanks
Doctor:
Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic.I can understand your concern. Since you are taking warfarin (blood thinner), possibility of pulmonary embolism (PE) related pain is less likely.Possibility of musculoskeletal pain is more likely. So avoid heavyweight lifting and strenuous exercise. Avoid movements causing pain. Apply warm water pad on affected areas of chest and back. Take painkiller and muscle relaxant drugs like ibuprofen and thiocolchicoside. You will mostly improve with all these in 2-3 days. If not improving then consult doctor. Hope I have solved your query.

Doctor:
Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic.I can understand your concern. In my opinion, you should take her to SGPGI, Lucknow and consult pulmonologist there.She needs bronchoscopy, BAL (bronchoalveolar lavage) analysis and TBLB (Trans bronchial lung biopsy).BAL analysis will identify the causative organism for pneumonia. TBLB is needed to rule out lung cancer. Don't worry, she will be alright. First diagnose her and then start appropriate treatment. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further.

Patient:
My 80 year old wife is home recovering from pneumonia (double) twice in August. Her blood pressure has dropped to 82/44. How dangerous and how can I increase the level. Hospital sent her home with oral antibiotics the first time, no antibiotics the second time. She has been treated for this disease 4 times in past 12 months.
Doctor:
Low blood pressure can be a serious and life-threatening problem. Is her blood pressure normally a lot higher than this? If so, then I would suggest urgent evaluation by a physician. Infections can lead to a response called sepsis, and part of this may include a drop in blood pressure, which can be dangerous to her organs. Ensuring adequate hydration is important, as dehydration can cause low blood pressure as well. If she is acting confused, fatigued, or more tired than usual then I would suggest urgent medical evaluation. I hope she feels better.

However, I had an X-ray and it apparently showed nothing at all, although all my symptoms were in line with pneumonia and my GP had definitely heard a lot of crackles in the left lung.  Is it possible that I had pneumonia if the Xray was clear?
Doctor:
Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic.I can understand your concern. For diagnosis of pneumonia, chest x ray need to have infiltration.With normal chest x ray, pneumonia is not possible. Cough, congestion, crackles on auscultation are also seen with bronchitis. And bronchitis shows normal chest x ray too.So it is quite possible that you improve within antibiotic because antibiotics also work in bronchitis.

Doctor:
Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic.I can understand your concern. Possibility of post infectious bronchitis is more likely. Bronchitis (inflammation of airways) is common after pneumonia.And persistent dry cough and chest pain are mostly due to bronchitis.So better to consult pulmonologist and get done clinical examination of respiratory system and PFT (Pulmonary Function Test).PFT will not only diagnose bronchitis but it will also tell you about severity of the disease and treatment is based on severity only. You will mostly improve with inhaled bronchodilators (formoterol or salmeterol) and inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) (budesonide or fluticasone).Don't worry, you will be alright with all these.

Can cough lead to pneumonia or tuberculosis?

Dialogue
Patient:
NAME: BrentAGE: 22SEX: MaleSYMPTOMS : I have a cough that seems to be reccursive. It occurs usually at nightime, or if I gave a very intense sneeze or laugh. When this cough occurs, it is very dry, that it would sound like a yelping dog.  Also, besides cough, I do experience a reccursive runny nose, sometimes coupled with watery red eyes and itchy throat. The runny nose discharge is transparent, almost like saliva or tears. Ironically, after a while, these symptoms would disappear, and when they do disappear, I feel completely normal.  I have already consulted a doctor and was diagnosed of allergic rhinits. She adviced me to take anti histamines, either zirtec or iterax, which ever do i prefer. Unfortunately, it works at often but not at all times. HOW MANY DAYS?:Reccursive cough has been going on since april of this year. As for the runny nose, since november of last year ALLERGIES: not that i know of, When I was five years old, I remember being diagnosed of Primary Complex, but was able to be treated before it goes into something else.  Also, TB runs in the family, as my uncle had it before, and so as my mom (although the doctor said it was already a scar).  As for me, 2009 was a stressful year. There were months, when my hours of daily sleep was only around 3 to four hours due to school work. Also, for a period of time I was involved in smoking, although it has been a month since I stopped. Doctor, I would just like to know what are the chances of me, acquiring respiratory illness like pneumonia or tuberculosis, or development of asthma? Also, if i get to consult a doctor personally with my parents, will the doctor be able to detect my past smoking habit, based on the procedures he will do, or with tests that he will recommend like xray? The truth is, I am hesitant to go to a medical clinic, because my parents have to accompany me, and I am afraid that the doctor might make "bisto"  towards my parents, as they don't know that I do smoke.  But i do really want to seek medical attention. Besides the incovenicence of symtpoms, I am worried that it might be something serious.  Hoping for a  share of your brilliant expertise. thank you doctor and good day.
Doctor:
Thanks for your concern. The dry cough basically has a few causes....First is Post nasal drip, second  Gastroesophageal reflux'heart burn', third Cough variant aasthma, forth Heart failure and finally Interstitial lung disease. Based on the information if you don't have a heart burn or reflux of food or sour brash into your mouth, you are having a cough variant asthma, make sure you do not have difficulty breathing. There is something called cardiac asthma, but it's not much of a likelihood given your young age.I advice you that you give up on smoking as it causes a multitude of problems and may well be related to the cough you've been having now called as 'smokers cough'.It's time that you stop smoking, avoid animal dancers, mites, pollens and any thing that would exacerbate the illness, make sure you don't have a heart burn, and if still the cough persists , meet a pulmo neologism and get a Pulmonary function test with methacholine challenge

my boyfriend was put in the hospital for strep a nemonia 5 days ago yesterday they done another x ray and said that his nemonia was getting worse and had spread to his left lung and was also in his right real bad they also done a culture on the stuff that hes been coughing up out of his lungs and today they told us he has staph in his lungs how dangerous is this and what should be done
Doctor:
Hello Thank you for trusting HCM Dear what is the culture report suggestive?? Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia take more time to come under control, usually community acquired Staphylococcus infection may present with methicillne resistance(MRSA) , for this patient cases need to treated with vancomycine, and linezolid. Some patients also developed vancomycine resistant staph aureus (VRSA) infection, this infection very problematic to control. very few drugs like Quinupristin-dalfopristin and linezolid available to control VRSA. Please follow your doctor orders they will treat you in right way. I think I answered to your question if you have more questions please feel free to ask.

Dialogue
Patient:
Hello. About 3-4 weeks ago I was diagnosed with pneumonia. After two weeks I felt well enough to start getting back out, but I continued to cough up mucus. I got in the swimming pool last night and it was an outdoor pool and kind of cool. this morning I woke up with fever, wheezing bad and my back in my lung area hurts so bad. The coughing is getting worse too. Could the pneumonia have came back or never left? What should I do?
Doctor:
Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic.I can understand your concern. Swimming pool water is full of organisms. So possibility of relapse of pneumonia is more likely because your symptoms, coughing, wheezing, chest pain are more suggestive of pneumonia. So consult your doctor and get done clinical examination of respiratory system and chest x ray. If chest x ray is showing fresh infiltrates then you will need another course of antibiotics, mucolytic and expectorant drugs. Avoid swimming for atleast 1 month.Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.

i am 46yrs old two wks ago i was diagnosed with pneumonia and the same time i had this suffercation feelin which was really scary i have had two lots of antibiotics and a nasal spray, today is the first day it has felt ok but im worried its goin to come back
Doctor:
Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic.I can understand your concern. In my opinion, you are mostly having bronchospasm which is causing this suffocating feeling. Pneumonia causes inflammation in airways and this in turn causes bronchospasm. So in my opinion, you should ask your doctor about starting inhaled bronchodilators like formoterol or salmeterol to relieve bronchospasm. Also avoid stress and tension, be relax and calm. Don't worry, you will be alright with all these. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.

Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic.I can understand your concern. Pneumococcal vaccine is live attenuated vaccine. So it is contraindicated in active infections like pneumonia because it can flare up infection. So better not to take pneumococcal vaccine at present.

Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic.I can understand your concern.

What causes cough when diagnosed with pneumonia?

Dialogue
Patient:
the bottom of my lungs hurt when i yawn. Its been going on for about 3 months right after my boyfriends grandmother got sick with pneumonia and sepsis. Im worried that something could be wrong because I was in the hospital with her a lot and she cough on me quite a bit and I am a type one diabetic should I go talk to my family doctor about it?
Doctor:
Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic.I can understand your concern.Yes, you should definitely consult your doctor.Pneumonia spread by coughing. So you might have cought infection from your boyfriend 's grandmother. You are also a diabetic, so lung infections are very easy to affect you.So better to consult your doctor and get done clinical examination of respiratory system and chest x ray.If chest x ray is normal then no need to worry for pneumonia, take simple painkiller like paracetamol for your chest pain.Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.

Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic.I can understand your concern.You have given oral antibiotic for pneumonia.This itself suggests that you are had walking pneumonia (no serious type).Levofloxacin is broad spectrum antibiotic and usually sufficient for walking pneumonia.So if you are don't have fever or coughing at present and feel good then you can definitely fly.

I am recovering from Double Bilateral Pneumonia in hospital 3 days. I m an RT so I knew I had to use incentive spirometer and nebulizers for 2 weeks I am 2 weeks post discharge.

During the day I occasionally need o2 I am on medical leave for 4 weeks is this going to get easier to breath soon I am resting as much as possible. I don t have much choice rather rest than feel pain I. Chest.
Doctor:
Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic.I can understand your concern.Pneumonia usually takes 2-3 weeks for complete recovery.Your oxygen requirement is decreasing. This is suggestive of recovery. So you will definitely be alright after 4 weeks. So get done repeat chest x ray to see how much pneumonia is recovered.Chest physiotherapy, deep breathing exercises, incentive spirometry are vital to achieve good lung functions after pneumonia.Don't worry, you will be alright.Hope I have solved your query.

Can pneumonia affect lung function?

Dialogue
Patient:
Good day,My son, who is 4 yrs old, has been diagnosed with lobar pneumonia and is now hospitalised.  This is about his 6th or 7th infection.  He had a double aortic arch that led to the entrance of his right lung and his trachea and esophagus being squeezed. He is now diagnosed with asthma.  Can the pneumonia deplete his lung function over time? What, if anything, can I do to reduce the number of infections?
Doctor:
Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic.I can understand your concern.Yes, recurrent lung infections can directly diminish lung functions.Recurrent infections can also cause asthma, bronchitis and further deteriorate lung functions.Best way to prevent respiratory tract infection is vaccines.Give him pneumococcal and influenza vaccines.These vaccines will provide 80% protection. Give him fruits, multivitamin tablets and protein powder for high immunity.Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wishing good health to your son. Thanks.

hello doc.Im Gigi 51 yrs old previously i have ptb but the doctor told me that it was cured already 7 yrs ago every time i go to his clinic he told me i have a pneumonia after en x-ray result even though i told him that i spit w/ blood last monday i go to his clinic agin for a medical check up and he prescribed me cefuruxime kefstar i bought 9 pcs only and switch to another brand of cefuruxime Axetil after 4 days i spit mucus w/ blood as for now im suffering severe backpain what should i do thank you so much doc
Doctor:
Hello Gigi !Coughing up blood with sputum (henoptysis) is a red flag sign .. meaning to say it definitely needs Medical attention . Considering you have had TB in the past there are many possibilities for your present episodes of hemoptysis.  It could me a bacterial infection or relapse of TB or post TB bronchiectasis (abnormal permanent dilation of your airways at few places which happens when they get damaged due to your past TB). Take a course of antibiotic as prescribed by your physician ,Consult with your physician  and discuss about taking drugs like tranexemic acid which reduce the bleeding tendency , cough suppressants . while sleeping, Lie on the side which was previously affected by TB and be on complete bed rest . Once your hemoptysis gets controlled go for sputum examination to check for TB bacilli , chest x ray and if needed HRCT thorax (to pick up bronchiectasis which can sometimes be not evident on x ray). Since u mentioned severe back pain , vascular abnormalities concerning  the descending aorta (the major blood vessel carrying blood from the heart)needs to be also considered  Treatment is to be decided based on the cause for your hemoptysis.Do review with your physician and get the necessary investigations done.

Hi- I was diagnosed a month ago with community pneumonia. After two rounds of antibiotics I was feeling better. Now my cough is back and I have a strange heavy feeling especially in my legs. I have been exhausted too for the last few days. Could this be from pneumonia?
Doctor:
Hello! Just because you have previously had a pneumonia does not necessarily mean this time too You will be having it again. Since how long have you been having cough ? Are you having a dry cough or produce phlegm ? what's the colour of the phlegm ? last time you had pneumonia was it properly n completely treated ? Apart from cough what are your other complaints at present ? your cough can be due to inflammation of your throat lining or it can be something to do with your lungs like previous time.  Kindly get your checked by a physician with an open mind and go for a Chest X ray if necessary.

Doctor:
It sound like your cousin has something called- Empyema. It is basically an abscess in the chest cavity. And the correct treatment for it is drainage - which was done appropriatley. But he should receive antibiotic treatment with coverage of both aerobic and anaerobic organisms. Usually specimens are send from the procedure to see which organisms grow and provide a more directed antibiotic coverage.

Doctor:
Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. In my opinion, her diarrhoea is mostly due to amoxicillin. Amoxicillin can cause diarrhea on second exposure. So you should stop amoxicillin. There are options for oral antibiotics other than amoxicillin like cefixime, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin etc. And left basal pneumonia means lung infection in lower lobe of left lung. So antibiotics are the mainstay of treatment. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wishing good health to your mother.Thanks.

A round of stronger antibiotics were then given to her. She went back for a follow up xray last week and the xray now shows the pneumonia is in both lungs. The strange thing is...she has NO symptoms. No coughing, no fever, nothing. Could it possibly be viral? or fluid? or cancer???? Btw she has never smoked in her life.
Doctor:
Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. Radiological resolution takes 2-3 weeks in pneumonia. So it is possible that patient of pneumonia is improved symptomatically but still show pneumonia on chest x ray. So in my opinion, you should should waiting for 2 weeks more. Get done repeat chest x ray after 2 weeks.If chest x ray is showing pneumonia then go for CT thorax and bronchoscopy to rule out lung cancer, Tuberculosis, Fungal pneumonia. If xun4 ray is improving then no need to worry. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wishing good health to your mother. Thanks.

Doctor:
Thanks for your question on Healthcare Magic. I can understand your concern. Bronchiectesis is permanently damaged part of lung. So bacterial colonization is common in bronchiectesis. And this gives repeated pneumonia attacks. So best and permanent cure for this is surgical removal of bronchiectic part of lung. So consult Cardio thoracic surgeon and discuss about surgical removal. Another option is culture and sensitivity based treatment. Get done sputum culture and sensitivity report. Culture will identify the causative organism and sensitivity report will guide about effective antibiotic treatment. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further.

Patient:
What is the advisability of exercise in the year following treatment with Levofloxaxin for pneumonia? I just completed 5 days of treatment with pills after 4 or more days of IV in the hospital following gall bladder surgery. I entered the hospital with pneumonia (not knowing I had it), probably having contracted it from my brother who had it and whom I had visited several days earlier in another hospital. I am 71 years old, female; I had a non-heart damaging heart attack in 2003 and have tried to maintain a good exercise program to lessen my chances of worsening heart disease. Should I resume Naproxen for joint/muscle pain; had 2 doses (2 tablets twice daily) 2 days before hospitalization. Did not need it the 3rd day and was hospitalized the next day. Did not take it post hospitalization. Do not remember if they gave it in hospital; think not. Thank you.
Doctor:
Hello welcome to HCM. I have gone through your history. You have been adequately treated for your pneumonia and I suppose you don't have any symptoms of pneumonia like cough, fast breathing, fever, breathlessness. Since you have received intravenous plus 5 days of oral antibiotics, now you can resume about your exercise regime. As you say you had a non damaging heart attack, means that your heart pumping function is well preserved. So you must not have any issues with exercise. With every lung infection the lung capacity decreases by some percentage proportional to he severity of the infection. Hence along with your routine exercises you must also undergo breathing exercises with incentive spirometry, inhaling deeply through one nose holding your breath and exhaling fully from the other nose, meditation and yoga. This will help you to regain some of the lost lung capacity. You should also get vaccinated with influenza and pneumonia vaccines that include common strains which cause pneumonia Remember they don't protect you against all pneumonias but offer protection against common pneumonias.Regarding Naproxen too much of it may cause damage to your kidneys so I advice you decrease its usage and use it only when required rather than a daily basis.Wishing you good health.

my daughter was thought to have pneomonia back in sept.  after several courses of antibiotics and ct scans they found a spot on both lungs that was growing and the pet scan showed a spot on the brain.  lung biopsy was inconclusive.  Dr.s beginning thought before biopsy was bacterial infection.  Is it likely something like this would go to the brain

Respected user, hi it is unlikely to disseminate lung pathology to brain in your case.It may be existing condition in brain detected afterwards or occurrence with/ after the lung pathology.Hope this clears your query.Thanks for using Health care magic & giving me an opportunity to assist you.Regards dear take care.

Respected user, hi I evalauted your query thoroughly.Sorry to hear about the issue.*Prognosis depends on many factors - age - associated comorbid conditions   like heart attack / cv stroke / kidney malfunctions / diabetes - immunity  - haemoglobin level - body response to treatment - competency of doctors  - efficacy of molecules used in treatment & much more list not possible to  narrate whole here.*Considering all your narrations, her prognosis is guarded, not that much  good as normal person suffering from pneumonia recovering in days. - She may take very long time for recovery & may not recover also ( I pray   to God that doesn`t happen ) after your long jugglery with all ventilator   period. - I can suggest to see the progress of the patient on ventilator for 5-7 days   discuss with the consultant in details regarding this & then decide to    continue the treatment or wean her off from ventilator for resting her   sole in peace. Hope this clears your query. Thanks for using Health care magic & keeping trust in our medical services Regards

What does coughing up of clear phlegm indicate while treating pneumonia?

Dialogue
Patient:
I was diagnosed with pneumonia 2 days ago at med express and was given a prescription for levoquin. I cough up clear phlegm. My research tells me I m being treated for bacterial pneumonia but the clear phlegm ,Indicates viral pneumonia. I m a 67 year old male who quit smoking last November.
Doctor:
Hello sir,Seeing at your history would like to know more about your case.Want to look at your chest x ray first.and if its definitely diagnosed pnemonia, then in case you could be right that it could be viral pneumonia.but you can't stamp it as viral from clear phlegm. Get done white blood counts which will be within normal limits in case of viral and high in case of bacterial pneumonia. Also get done Procalcitonin and CRP level of your blood. it will give you final idea.And as you were smoker phlegm might be due to Bronchiectesis or COPD. rule out that.

How to treat walking pneumonia?

Dialogue
Patient:
My fiancé has been coughing uncontrollably every night for the past 4 months. He is 23 years old, 5'9", about 140 lbs., and has been told by his dr that he has walking pneumonia. He has been prescribed antibiotics, cough syrup, allergy medicine, mucinex, nasal sprays, and inhalers and although they suppress the coughing at times he still does not seem to have gotten rid of the coughing. His coughing is accompanied with phlegm and has also caused him to throw up due to the extremity. He does smoke cigars as well. What is this!?
Doctor:
Walking pneumonia is a non-medical term to describe a mild case of pneumonia. It is usually called atypical pneumonia because the disease is different from more serious cases of pneumonia caused by typical bacteria. it is often the result of a lung infection from a bacterial microorganism called Mycoplasma pneumoniae and generally treated with antibiotics. Mild infections are often not treated because they tend to clear on their own. With treatment, most people begin to feel better within a few days.

What are the signs and symptoms of pneumonia or pertussis?

Dialogue
Patient:
How can one be sure of a diagnosis of pneumonia or pertusses in adults. How do you compare? My doc thinks I have pertusses. But the doctor in Mexico where I was originally treated said I had PB pneumonia. I was on intravenous antibiotics for three days in Mexico before coming home to my dr.here in L.A.The xrays showed lots of mucus in my lungs.  I am confused.  is there a definitive test for petusses in adults? Dr said I will be fine. Gave me ADVAIR and cough medicine and says I will be fine but will cough for a pretty long while until the lungs are clear.  He said I do not need antibiotics because I have already had zpack and 10 days of ampicillin, and then 3 days fo intravenous antibiotics. Who do I believe? I am 65 years old. never was feeling this sick or tired before or have had any kind of lung involvement in my life.  I am a strong healthy woman. No immune deficiency or anything like that.
Doctor:
Respected Sir, hi. Diagnosis of Pertussis is clinical usually,divided into 3 stages .1st stage (catarrhal) where runny nose, sneezing, low grade fever, occasional cough. 2nd stage (paroxysmal) bursts of coughing or numerous rapid coughs, difficult to expel thick mucus from airways in lungs , long respiratory effort with high-pitch breath sound , individual may have cyanosis with or without vomiting during severe attack, inbetween attacks, patient becomes normal.3rd stage is convalescent or recovery gradually from above all. overall period may range from 1-2 weeks to 10-12 weeks.  In which cases diagnosis is not certain or require confirmation *Culture of bacterium Bordetella pertusis from nasal secretions *PCR test identifying genetic material from the bacterium in nasal secretions. Hope this clears your query dear madam, thanks regards take care, bye, wishing you fast speedy recovery from the same.

Went to the doctor 3 weeks ago for possible exercise induced asthma due to chest pain. They have me a daily steriod inhaler and albuterol rescue inhaler. The did an xray as well and a few days later I found out I had pneumonia. I did a zpack for 5 days and now levaquin 500mg twice daily on day 7 or 10. Just last night I went to urgent they said I still have the pneumonia got a steroid injection and a medrol dose pack. Still getting worse...not sure what to do and the chest pain seems worse, and the levaquin has made my stomach very irritated which is expected. The steroids make sleeping impossible and I constantly feel overheated since the injections and dose pack I started yesterday.
Doctor:
Hi and welcome in HCMAccording to the history this might be  a situation called *Nonresponding Pneumonia*It would be better to be hospitalized for further examinations like:CRPHemogramALT,ASTChest CT (if needed)ABGFor exploring better the situation and do the treatment in i/v route .If you have comorbidites they should be evaluated too.Sometimes when the other comorbidities are not well treated the pneumonia does not respond so well from the treatment.So please discuss with your doctor for the aboveRegardsDr.Jolanda

Dialogue
Patient:
I went to the doctor today and found out that I have pneumonia. I got a steroid injection and breathing treatment in the office and was sent home with levaquin, albuterol, and cough medicine. My forearms and legs are very tingly and almost numb and heavy feeling. Is this from the steroid injection? I am 23 years old and I have juvenile rheumatoid arthritis so I am also taking humira, methotrexate, plaquenil, and folic acid for the RA. Is this a side effect or a drug reaction or nothing to be concerned about?
Doctor:
Tingling in extremities may be a sign of peripheral neuropathy, wich is most of the cases caused by inflammatory injury to the nerves. Anti-TNF drugs, such as Humira, have been reported to be associated to this kind of injury, that can be potentialized when associated to steroids. You should visit your attending rheumathologist for physical evaluation and apropriate management.

Dialogue
Patient:
My father is in the hospital on ventilator currently.  The doctor says he now has what is considered whiteout in his lungs.  He has said that the outline of the heart can no longer be seen.  My father aspirated and then was diagnosed with pneumonia.  Three days later he ended up in ccu on a ventilator and has not been able to be weened off/  He is currently taking 3 antibiotics.  What is your advise.
Doctor:
Lung whiteout and loss of heart outline are findings of chest x-ray compatible with many abnormal conditions affecting the lungs, like pneumonia, pleural effusion, acute respiratory distress syndrome among others. In the actual setting, your father is already receiving treatment to his pneumonia. All the other possibilities are probably been considerated and adressed by CCU staff. Weaning from mechanical ventilation is sometimes challenging because many factors can impair patients evolution, like how long he's been in MV, his nutrition status, his cardiovascular performance and resolution of the cause that led him to MV in the first place.

Doctor:
Hello and thank you for asking in HCM I can understand your concern Don't worry so much. Your husband is under treatment for pneumonia according to the history and he has had fever several times.Now he feels better but he is not completely asymptomatic which means that the feeling he had might be due to an episode of temperature not so high .This shows that the treatment is doing well. But he has to be careful with the treatment to be correct as the doctor has prescribed ,no smoking and not to work in dust environment ,a lot of liquids too.Take careWish a fast recovery for your husband.

Booster vaccinations. You should have had a booster at 12 years and that lasts for 10 years. If your last Tdap was at 6yrs then you are overdue. I agree with waiting for after the COVID pandemic unless you have an injury that would require tetanus immunity. Stay safe. .

Will coronavirus make my kids more susceptible to catching the flu? Should all kids be vaccinated against the flu in case they catch COVID-19?
Doctor:
In brief:   It may help.   Coronavirus infections may make individuals more susceptible to catching other viral or bacterial infections, esp.   if there are underlying respiratory conditions such as asthma or COPD, cardiac conditions or immunocompromised states. Flu vaccines may afford a certain level of protection to kids, but they do not protect against all strains of the influenza virus.   Would you like to video or text chat with me?

Doctor:
Depends-all factors. Type I diabetics can be more fragile when they have any type of infection unfortunately. If you are younger & do not smoke & do not have other chronic problems, your increased risk may be minimal.  Eating balanced diet, keeping glucose controlled, getting adequate exercise (including fresh air outdoors), & adequate sleep all should help protect you from severe consequences, but be very careful ! .

Doctor:
Sounds risky. Using symptoms of fever, cough, or runny nose to screen for COVID-19 is not accurate because colds and flu have such symptoms. COVID testing is by nasal swab, but there's a shortage of test kits in this pandemic. Only local resources know local testing sites, times, restrictions. Even a negative test does not guarantee one does not have COVID-19. Safest for people to stay away from ICU patients.

Doctor:
COVID-19? It sounds like your mom is in good hands. If she has COVID, they will know how to treat it. If the pneumonia is beleived to be bacterial, they will treat with antibiotics. There is no proved effective treatment for coronavirus itself. Ask her doctors if she is a candidate for remdesivir -- not proved effective but sometimes available on a "compassionate" basis for severely ill patients. Good luck.

I advise,if your decision is to be vaccinated,to do it over a period of 6 weeks..I like a little bit on day 1 ,then more 2 weeks later and more two weeks later still.That way you get the full killed vaccine ,and your body develops an immune response with its ability still intact to fight Covid 19 if necessary.

Hi, I'm on Plasmaquine and Methotrexate 7.5mg x 1 per week for arthritis. I'm concerned that the Methotrexate may weaken my immune system and make me more vulnerable to Covid-19. Would it not be safer to discontinue use untill the threat has passed?

Doctor:
COVID-19 and RA. Some anecdotal data showed that chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine might have activity against COVID-19. Observation from China Wuhan noted that patients with RA and on these medications had low incidence of COVID-19 infection. There is however no definite proof yet at this time.  In terms of whether you can stop methotrexate, you better discuss with your rheumatologist for the benefit and risk. .

Doctor:
Safer to quarantine. Screening procedures to identify who has COVID-19 are not very reliable and vary depending on location (city, county, state, nation) and entity type (airline boarding, border control, clinic, school, etc.). Three months into the epidemic, the safest is to self-quarantine for 14-21 days upon arrival. Reliable test for virus is via nasal swab, but there's a shortage of test kits in most places.

But so can viral diseases (common cold, Flu, Covid-19, etc.  ) that are not treatable with antibiotics that are designed to treat bacterial infections. Call your General Physician and report your symptoms.  Would you like to video or text chat with me?

Doctor:
Yes. Protection. It is not enough symptoms to say that you are a suspect case of COVID19; but, independently of this, if you have been in contact with a case, or you present persistent cough (with or without sputum), shortness of breath, wheezing, or you have a chronic disease like diabetes, hypertension, low immune system or cancer, should ask for medical attention. And use all the protection measures.

Doctor:
Not stablished. All caution measures should be applied, including social distancing, sanitizer, and protection mask when crowded places are inevitable. Although MBL deficiency causes increased susceptibility to infections, mostly in people with chronic diseases, COVID-19 outbreak is so recent that a specific relationship with this disease has not been stablished. Anyway, have extreme caution and use protection.

Doctor:
Protection. Stay at home as much as possible, clean your hands and your children hands after any contact with people, alcohol is very helpful; avoid touching your face when you are not sure your hands are clean. In crowded places, wear protection like N95 surgical mask. Playing outside is ok, but apply these measures and stay way 6 ft from any unknown health status person.

Doctor:
In brief:   If you are dying   Everything is in motion and medical decisions are fluid, so you won't know until it happens.   That's because a healthy person under 50 won't die (has maybe half a percent chance of dying) from COVID-19, but a guy aged 70-80 has a 7-8% chance of dying from this... about the same as a non-elderly diabetic. That means the old guy and the diabetic both have about a 92-93% chance of NOT dying. (3/25/20)  Would you like to video or text chat with me?

Doctor:
In brief:   Any contagiousness   A person with any signs of respiratory infection or gastrointestinal infection should be isolated to prevent spread of his infection.   Allergies can cause symptoms similar to infection symptoms, which means a person with allergy symptoms at this pandemic time should also be isolated. Note that if every person is isolated for 3-4 weeks, the pandemic stops because virus transmission stops.  (3/25/20)  Would you like to video or text chat with me?

If sore throat get worse this could be strep throat need a culture to be taken from your throat by your doctor followed by antibiotic.

One way to look at it is that we are all in this together, irregardless of political party, race, or religion. As a people, we can overcome a simple virus and be stronger as a whole.

Doctor:
In brief:   Basics   Fever is a normal body response when ill that increases circulation & oxygen supply to the tissues so natural healing comes faster.I would never treat minor fevers around 38 nor would I alternate  fever meds.  One or the other would be all I use when needed.  New data supports avoiding all ibuprofen products when corona virus may be present.  Would you like to video or text chat with me?

Might be more severe. People with diabetes can have more fragile immune systems with difficulty fighting infections, so if you contract coronavirus you might be at greater risk for breathing complications.  Any serious illness can affect blood sugar control in diabetics also. I recommend taking extra precautions to minimize contact with people so as to avoid contacting the virus.  .

Doctor:
In pandemic times... The COVID-19 infection is worldwide, in all but some isolated areas. The goal is to keep people separate so that the clinics and hospitals are not overwhelmed. Patients with medical symptoms should see their primary care doctor on VIDEO or by PHONE, and get instructed to go to a clinic or ER only if not treatable by video or phone. Symptoms of COVID-19 are often the same as a cold or the flu.

Rash. How long has it been going on?  May be food allergies, most common are dairy products so you could try a week with  no dairy and see if there is a change, others allergens include eggs , wheat.   Could try Zyrtec children's 2 ml once a day and see if it helps itching. Rarely I have seen strep manifest with rash for which  you need a culture.

Hard to guess. You have some of the  symptoms of cold , flu and covid19 . Also you appear to be dehydrated. But you are young and no mention of any underlying medical condition. So, i  think you are not vulnerable.  Drink at least 6 cups of water a day. Probably need self isolation for 2 weeks and to be tested in mean time for covid19 if you develop breathing problem.

Re: COVID-19 -- Is it safe to go out in public without a face mask on right now as long as the recommended 6ft distance is maintained? Am wondering if picking up groceries curbside (have to get out of car and open trunk for store employee) is safe?
Doctor:
In brief:   Yes and no.   Yes for the first question.   For the second question i should say no because the possibility of the store employee coming close less than 6 feet is great. But what you can do is you get out of the car open the truck and then call the store employee for a curb side pick up leaving always a 6 feet distance between two of you.

In this pandemic, one's primary care doctor, who knows the patient well, can usually get meds to the patient without an in-person visit... unless an exam is needed in order to adjust the meds.

Doctor:
In brief:   Tummy Bug   GI symptoms are rare with Coronavirus.    SOB and Dry cough and fever common. Testing should lead to a purposeful action and at this time there is none. That is there is no medication to get and treatment for the virus is rest and social isolation which you do not need a test to do. If you do get cough and SOB then notify your provider and get checked. The virus typically runs for 10 to 14 days.  Would you like to video or text chat with me?

Doctor:
In brief:   Life is not exact   In pandemic times, supplies are short.   Life is not that exact. That means 57.6% is fine, and if a person catches the coronavirus, it won't be because she was missing 2% on her hand sanitizer. Remember that the virus goes from person to person. If there are no people close by, and if the high-touch surfaces like table tops, keyboards, or doorknobs are clean, then one is a lot safer.

Patients can be presumed positive regardless of whether they got tested or not, as there's no way to test everyone. No good outpatient treatment found yet.

Associated with phlegm and mucus?
Doctor:
Cough,phlegm. At this time your symptoms are characteristic of a viral upper respiratory tract infection, and if your sputum is very discolored, bronchitis may be present. Absence of fever,chills, chest discomfort,shortness of breath or wheezing is reassuring but your MD may recommend starting antibiotic treatment. Leave it to him/her whether covid19 treating is advisable depending upon exposure history.

Doctor:
Get meds refilled. With the COVID-19 pandemic, people with chronic conditions or even intermittent conditions should get their meds refilled in case pharmacy services close down. For asthma patients, they should refill their inhalers. Some use only an urgent "rescue" inhaler like albuterol, while others also use "preventive" inhalers like fluticasone. It's best to keep both on hand. If symptoms go bad, it's ER time.

I have some suspected mulluscum on most of my stomach but it's itchy, inflammed, sentitive, and it's spreading. Aren't most people supposed to around 20 bumps? Why is it peeling so much?  Most of all, what is the best way to treat mulluscum at home?
Doctor:
In brief:   Hard to get rid of   Molluscum is a virus, the less you touch the lesions the less you will spread the infection.   If you want to get rid of it it’s hard, but would suggest a dermatologist rather than the freezing sprays or chemicals used to kill the virus in the skin. There is no ‘limit’ to number of lesions, have not heard that information, but I would not believe that  Would you like to video or text chat with me?

At what temperature range (external temperature) will the COVID-19 virus be destroyed?  This in relation to (restaurants) cooking food and safety.  What does COVID stand for?

Dialogue
Patient:
At what temperature range (external temperature) will the COVID-19 virus be destroyed?  This in relation to (restaurants) cooking food and safety.  What does COVID stand for?
Doctor:
In brief:   High temperature   COVID stands for 'COrona VIrus Diesase'.   We know that high temperature kills most pathogens eg protozoa, viruses and bacteria. That's why cooking is recommending for certain foods rather than eating it 'raw'. Temperatures of 140 to 160 degree F kills most pathogens including viruses. Corona viruses are sensitive to heat and cooking will destroy the outer protein layer and kill the virus.   Would you like to video or text chat with me?

Can a cool mist vaporizer help with the Corona virus since it doesn’t like humidity?
Doctor:
Not particularly. The facts are your nose & upper airway add humidity to the air you breathe to the point it reaches ~100% at the level of air exchange. Vaporizers help loosen thicker mucus in the upper airways so you can cough it up, but it would not have any effect on the deep airways or any germs that reach them. .

In brief:   Likely nerve pain   this diagnosis would require a visit and imaging but the most likely cause is either pressure on a nerve in your neck or referred pain from the neck and shoulder with symptoms felt at the shoulder/shoulder blade.

Do you have any idea how long novel coronavirus stays on cash money?
Doctor:
Uncertain. The exact amount of time would depend on the inoculum or how much virus was deposited and whether the cash were dry or moist . The limited studies suggest that the virus does not live very long on cardboard - about 4 hrs or so, so I suspect paper may be similar. If it were moist or wet, it may last longer. Heat may inactivate the virus, so consider setting the money in the sun or put in a drier.

I have had mild chest pain for over a week. it now seems more persistent and pronounced. I don't have shortness of breath or any other COVID-19 symptoms, except some fatigue. I have been traveling a lot in high risk areas. Should I get tested?
Doctor:
In brief:   Yes   I would advise screening due to your exposure.   Fever is very commonly associated with COVID-19. Stay at home, rest, drink fluids and monitor your temperature. Arrange the testing which also  may include a chest image with your PCP.  Since your have been traveling, a pulmonary embolism is another possible cause of your shortness of breath.

Doctor:
Shortness of breath. Covid testing is hard to come by. At 37 you are in a lower risk group.  And I doubt you could get a test. Keep isolated for two weeks. I know we have been ordering tests through HealthTap, but that does not lead to getting the test done, due to shortages. (3/21/20)

How do you get HPV on the cervix? Is it from skin to skin contact during intercourse from a partner’s genital touching the cervix? Thank you

Dialogue
Patient:
How do you get HPV on the cervix? Is it from skin to skin contact during intercourse from a partner’s genital touching the cervix? Thank you
Doctor:
In brief:   Basically the HPV virus is transferred within fluids generated during intercourse.   A mechanical skin contact appears to be part of the process but defining the exact amount of contact required is difficult. The genital strains of HPV are specific to those locations. There are other HPV strains that cause things like skin warts but these are different.  Would you like to video or text chat with me?

Doctor:
In brief:   Observatn is enough.   By looking at your child you'll know if he is having breathing difficulties.   Cough with a runny nose is common in children. You should be concerned only if he is refusing to play and eat, or if he develops breathing difficulties. Having a fever doesn't mean he has the Coronavirus. He is more likely to be infected with any of the common infections in your area of Gauteng.  Would you like to video or text chat with me?

Doctor:
Yes, Maybe, Maybe. We presume one is immune to a respiratory virus for a while after getting the infection (that's the way it is with other viruses). A few people have trouble with their antibodies and don't have much immunity. Shedding of viruses sometimes is longer than 14 days. In life, there will always be some people who get reinfected, for whatever reason. Usually one is immune after the infection. (3/21/20)

Doctor:
In brief:   Covid-19 unlikely.   The usual infections in your area of Kwa Zulu Natal are more likely to be the cause of his fever. If he is exposed to someone who is sick with Covid-19, then you need to be concerned.   Meanwhile, treat him as you would have treated him 2 months ago.  If he has shortness of breath or any form of difficulty breathing, get him to a doctor ASAP  Would you like to video or text chat with me?

Can coronavirus symptoms be mild for some people versus severe? For example, could it just involve being very fatigued, low grade fever for a few days and not the extreme symptoms? Or is it always a full blown cold and struggle to breathe?

Doctor:
In brief:   Can give Dr. a call.   Throat pain can be from a strep throat infection (antibiotics needed), a cold or influenza (antibiotics usually not used), or from other causes such as allergies, irritants, or COVID-19.   Usually, a person sees the doctor (call first) if the sore throat is bothersome, recurrent, or doesn't go away quickly. COVID-19 tends to have cough, whereas strep usually lacks cough but has more throat pain  Would you like to video or text chat with me?
